/**
  Standard KDE address book

  This class provides access to the standard KDE address book shared by all
  applications.

  It's implemented as a singleton. Use self() to get the address book
  object. On the first self() call the address book also gets loaded.

  Example:

  \code
  KABC::AddressBook *ab = KABC::StdAddressBook::self();

  AddressBook::Ticket *ticket = ab->requestSaveTicket();

  if ( ticket ) {
    KABC::AddressBook::Iterator it;
    for ( it = ab->begin(); it != ab->end(); ++it ) {
      kdDebug() << "UID=" << (*it).uid() << endl;

      // do some other stuff
    }

    KABC::StdAddressBook::save( ticket );
  }
  \endcode
