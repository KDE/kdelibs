-------------
This is version 4.5 of the KDE libraries.

This package includes libraries that are central to the development and
execution of a KDE program, as well as internationalization files for these
libraries, misc HTML documentation, theme modules, and regression tests.

Here is an alphabetical list of all individual libraries:

* dnssd
    Interface to the DNS-SD (Zeroconf) support.

* kimgio
    An all purpose extension to the qimgio class that supports various
    image formats.

* kio

* kjsembed
    A binding of the ECMAScript language to interface with KDE code.

* knewstuff
    Allows applications to easily download data from the Internet to add
    new information to the program. e.g. wallpapers, translation packs, etc.

* knotify
    Handles user notifications, including sounds, logging to files, etc.

* kparts
    KDE component model.

* kpty
    Abstraction layer for virtual consoles.

    Scripting host for KDE applications.

* kutils
    Utility library for printing, chatting and more.

* nepomuk
    Semantic information retrieval and tagging.

    Framework for the KDE 4 desktop shell and its widgets.

* security
    Certificate management and cryptography settings.

* solid
    Hardware detection.

* sonnet
    Tools for natural language processing, including spell and grammar check.
    Includes gui widgets.

* threadweaver
    Job-based threading library.

And here is an alphabetical list of all further parts of kdelibs:

* includes
    Qt-style include file wrappers.

* kconf_update
    Auto-Updater for config files.

* kded
    The KDE daemon checks for newly installed software, update files
    or hostname changes and takes according actions.

* kdoctools
    Contains mostly stuff convert XML docbook files via XSLT into
    human readable stuff.

* kioslave

Licensing
---------
The libraries themselves have been covered (since Saturday, June 21st, 1997)
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL). Any other programs (such
as the examples) are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL). All
the gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside
in COPYING.

Various parts are also covered under a BSD style license, detailed in
licenses/BSD. Currently, code covered under such license is copyrighted by
Theo de Raadt.

When in doubt, check the individual file, they should all have license
headings and other identifying marks.


Common Mistakes
---------------
If cmake claims Qt cannot be found, look at http://qt.nokia.com/
to get a copy of Qt, version 4.6 or newer. If you have peeked there
already, grab the SVN module qt-copy from anonsvn.kde.org, or a snapshot
thereof.  Alternatively the svn module qt-copy from svn.kde.org can also be
used.

If you know you have the latest Qt 4,  another reason it may not be able to
'find' QT is because it's finding an older version of QT 4.  Make sure that
your PATH is set appropriately  to find the qmake from the latest Qt 4, and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to include $QTDIR/lib.

Debugging
---------
You can set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE option with the cmake, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE libs. If you have the space and can stand code that's
somewhat slower, this is worth it. The extra information really
helps debugging and thus bugfixing.

Available options as of CMake 2.4.5:
 Release:        Compile with no debugging information, optimization enabled.
 Debug:          Minimal optimization, with debugging information.
 RelWithDebInfo: Normal optimization, with debugging information.
 MinSizeRel:     No debugging information, with optimization for smallest size.

e.g.: "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" when running cmake.

See also the file DEBUG.


Upgrading
---------
KDE 4 applications will try to migrate settings from your KDE 3 installation
where possible.


Compile Problems
----------------
Often, KDE compile failures are not KDE's fault, but the fault of the
compiler or the distribution used. For that reason, please have a look at
http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/FAQ for known issues in certain
OS environments before reporting bugs or going mad :).

KDE 4 requires gcc 3.3 or better as the compiler.

How to report
-------------
Reporting bugs is an art. Why?  Because bug reports can help and hinder.

They hinder if the developers are just buried in an avalanche of bug reports.
They spend hours figuring out which bug reports are valid and which aren't,
which bug reports are due to bugs or due to installation problems.

They can be of tremendous help to notify developers on problems in areas that
they normally don't have access (e.g. KDE on AIX) to.

So, here are some tips on bug reporting:

* Make sure your bug is due to KDE ... and not due to a packaging problem of
  your OS distributor. For example, most "I can not install the XYZ.rpm"
  problem are due to packaging issues. Refer with such questions to your
  OS Distributor and his appropriate mailing list or bug reporting tool.

* The chance is high that your bug has already been dealt with ... so look
  if there is a newer version of kdelibs available. Reporting bugs for
  older, deprecated versions usually don't get that much attention :-)

* Also the chance is high that another one experienced your problem. The
  bug report wizard at http://bugs.kde.org/ will help you to find out if your
  problem has already been reported.

* KDE Applications come with a Report Bug option in the Help menu that will
  fill out many of the forms on the bug reporter tool at http://bugs.kde.org/
  for you.

* The best bug report for a project based on voluntary work is of course one
  that comes with a patch that solves the problem. :-)


More info
---------
http://www.kde.org/ is a good starting point for info on KDE. If you are a
developer, you may also point your browser to http://techbase.kde.org/.
There is a plethora of mailing lists available, you can gain an overview
quickly by looking at http://lists.kde.org/.
