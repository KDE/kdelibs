About kdelibs
-------------

This is the version 1.1.2 release of the KDE libraries.  Among this
collection are ten (10) libraries that are central to the development and 
execution of a KDE program, internationalization files for these libraries, 
misc HTML documentation, and regression tests.  The ten libraries are:

* kdecore
    This is the core collection of KDE stuff.  Non GUI classes reside here.

* kdeui
    The main collection of misc. user interface classes (widgets).

* jscript
    A JavaScript interperter perhaps?  Who knows.

* kimgio
    An all purpose extension to the qimgio class that supports PNG and
    other image formats.

* khtmlw
    The main HTML rendering widget, due to be replaced by khwml (For the
    next release of kfm).

* kfmlib
    The kfm support library.  UhHuh.

* kfile
    This library contains the KFileDialog in all its glory.  A reasonably
    source compatable replacement to QFileDialog.

* mediatool
    Sound related classes (such as a mixer class), for use by anything
    that wants a rather neutral way to use sounds (and sound events)
    within KDE apps.

* kspell
    KSpell and related classes are a frontend to ispell for use within a
    GUI app.  kedit uses them already.

* kab
    The address book library.  See the README for more information.

Licensing
---------

The libraries themselves have been covered (since Saturday, June 21st, 1997)
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).  Any other programs (such as
the examples) are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL).  All the
gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside in 
COPYING.

Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.42.

If you get TOC overflow errors on AIX, and are using gcc 2.7.2, you'll
need to add -mminimal-toc to your CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE libs.  If you have the space and can stand code that's
somewhat slower, this is worth it.  The extra information really
helps debugging and thus bugfixing.

Upgrading
---------

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

More Info
---------

If you get odd error such as:

and you're using egcs, try re-compiling all your C++ libs with -fsquangle,
and then recompiling whatever you were working on with -fsquangle.  It
should help, and more information about this is available on the egcs FAQ
available at http://egcs.cygnus.com

Please direct any bug reports to me (kalle@kde.org). General KDE
discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).

Cow!
