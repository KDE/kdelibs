The libraries themselves have been covered (since Saturday, June 21st, 1997)
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).  Any other programs (such as
the examples) are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL).  All the
gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside in
COPYING.
 
Various parts are also covered under a BSD style license, detailed in
COPYING.BSD.  Currently, code covered under such license is copyrighted by
Theo de Raadt.
 
When in doubt, check the individual file, they should all have license
headings and other identifying marks.

All libraries that are in aRts are LGPL. 95% of all aRts code is in the
libraries, including the whole MCOP and ArtsFlow stuff. So you can use that
wherever you like. This also allows you writing plugins and not open up the
source, if you want that.
 
There are a few programs (such as artsd), these are GPLd. As there have been
different opinions, whether or not linking GPLd programs and Qt is legal, I
also added an explicite notice which allows that, additional to the GPL.
 
    Permission is also granted to link this program with the Qt
    library, treating Qt like a library that normally accompanies the
    operating system kernel, whether or not that is in fact the case.
