KDE NOTICE
==========

There used to be two versions of kde.deb : one made by debian, and 
one made by the KDE team. Fortunatly this has changed to the better
and this package is both: the debian package and the kde package.

Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@debian.org> used to maintain the debian part
and Stephan Kulow took them over, when he orphaned them.

Since then Ivan Moore has been working on them with Stephan's guidance
and has just recently taken them over completely.

1. About KDEDIR:
----------------

The debian KDE package has been modified so you do not need to set the
KDEDIR environment vairable to use it. You don't need to set QTDIR either.

2. Changes to KDE directory structure:
-------------------------------------

KDE's paths can mainly be organized independently. For Debian's sake,
I chose the below paths - following Andreas's settings.

/usr			prefix
/usr/bin		kde binaries (was KDE/bin)
/usr/lib		kde shared libraries (was KDE/lib)
/usr/include/kde	kde include files (was KDE/include)
/usr/lib/cgi-bin	kde cgi binaries (was KDE/cgi-bin)
/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML kde online documentation (was KDE/share/doc)
/etc/kde2		kde config files (was KDE/share/config)
/usr/share/applnk	kde applnk files (original)
/usr/share/mimelnk	kde mimelink files
/usr/share/icons	kde icons (and mini icons in .../icons/mini)
/usr/share/toolbar	kde toolbar icons (can also be used by other apps)
/usr/share/wallpapers	kde wallpaper icons (can also be used by other apps)
/usr/share/apps/APP	kde per application directory
/usr/share/locale	locales

3. Kpanel and menus:
-------------------

If you have the menu package installed, kpanel will display the debian menus 
of installed programs. Otherwise, you won't get any menus at all, so I do
recommend you install the menu package.
