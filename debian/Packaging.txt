Debian KDE Packaging
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


This document is meant as a aid for Debian Developers who are packaging
up KDE based applications.

dh-make
=======

You can now find a dh-make template for a single binary package under

    /usr/share/doc/kdelibs-dev/dh-make/

Refer to the dh-make man package for information on how to use these templates.
These templates include the bits mentioned in this file.


======================
Debian/KDE Menu System
======================

When building your package you will most likely end up with a debian/menu
file for creation of menu entries with the Debian menu system.  There are
2 customizations  you need to do for KDE specific packages.  The first is
the use of hints.  If you are unfamiliar with hints you should read up on
menu and it's features.  For all KDE based apps there needs to be a menu
tag of hints="KDE".   

   The other customization that is required is simple but it's necessity
is a bit more complex.  The tag "kderemove" needs to be used to make sure
there is no duplication in menu entries.  "What for?" you ask...well here's
why.  For every KDE app there is a corresponding .desktop file under the
/usr/share/applnk directory tree.  This is either provided by the package 
itself or created by the maintainer when one doesn't exist.  This file is used
by the KDE menu system to list the application within the KDE menu.  This
is how KDE handles it's menus...there must be a .desktop (or .kdelnk) file 
under /usr/share/applnk in order for it to show up on the KDE menu.  Well
by default this will only show KDE applications and not any of the other 
non-KDE apps you have installed on your computer.   So we use the Debian 
menu package to pull in all of the non-KDE applications.  The kdebase package
provides it's own menu-method which processes each of the menu items under
/usr/lib/menu and creates .desktop files under /var/lib/kde/menu.  There
is a symlink under /usr/share/applnk pointing to /var/lib/kde/menu so that
all of the .desktop files that are dynamically created by the menu program
and placed under /var/lib/kde/menu show up under a submenu of the KDE menu.
So now with every Debian package (including all the KDE packages) a .desktop
file is created.  In the case of all the KDE packages there is now 2 different
.desktop files representing the app...one which is part of the actual package
and one created by the Debian menu system.  One of these entries is in the
main KDE menu and the other is under the Debian submenu.  You would think this
isn't a real big problem..however KDE uses these .desktop files to handle
much more than menu entries.  So we need to make sure we don't have this
duplication.  The kderemove tag was created for this.  Basically if a menu
entry has kderemove="1" in it it will not create a .desktop file for that
application.  

With that said a typical menu file would look like this:

   ?package(konqueror):\
        needs=x11\
        section=Apps/Net\
        hints="KDE,Web browsers"\
        kderemove="y"\
        title="Konqueror"\
        command="kfmclient openProfile webbrowsing"


=============
Build-Depends
=============

Build-Depends are very important in the Debian world.  Most of the package
building on non-i386 ports are done with the aid of buildd's.  Buildd's are
automated building systems that basically build packages that are not already
built for the arch they are building on.  In order to do this and actually
be successful things like Build-Depends have to be accurate.  A typical 
Build-Depends line for a KDE based application will look something like this:

  Build-Depends: debhelper (>> 3.0.0), automake, autoconf, libtool, kdelibs-dev (>= 4:2.2.2-1)

Your app may need alot more than that to actually build however first take a
look at the Dependencies for kdelibs-dev:

   Depends: kdelibs3 (= 4:2.2.2-4), libarts-dev (= 4:2.2.2-4), libkmid-dev (= 4:2.2.2-4), libqt-dev (>= 3:2.3.1-1), uic (>= 3:2.3.1-1) | kde-designer, libaudiofile-dev, gettext, libtiff3g-dev | libtiff-dev, docbook, libpcre3-dev, libbz2-dev

and the Dependencies for libqt-dev:

   Depends: libc6 (>= 2.2.4-4), libpng2 (>= 1.0.12), libqt2 (>= 3:2.3.1-1), libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 (>= 1:2.95.4-0.010810), xlibs (>> 4.1.0), perl, libqt2 (= 3:2.3.1-16), libqutil1 (= 3:2.3.1-16), uic (= 3:2.3.1-16) | kde-designer, xlibs-dev, libmng-dev, libpng2-dev | libpng-dev, libjpeg62-dev | libjpeg-dev, zlib1g-dev | libz-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libc6-dev

so between the 2 of them you have Build-Depends that equate to:

  kdelibs-dev, libarts-dev, libkmid-dev, libqt-dev, libaudiofile-dev, gettext, libtiff3g-dev | libtiff-dev, jade, sgml-base, docbook, docbook-stylesheets, libpcre3-dev, xlibs-dev, libmng-dev, libpng2-dev, libjpeg62-dev, libz-dev, libfreetype6-dev

99% of the time that will more than cover a KDE app.  There will of course
be specific stuff you'll need to add....for example knetfilter requires iptables
to be installed in order for it to build...kdemultimedia requires ncurses, 
slang and other things to build.  Either way you should make sure you get them
all.

===========
debianrules
===========

   If your KDE based app uses the kde-common stuff you'll have a admin/ 
subdir which if it's recent will contain a debianrules perl script.  The
current version of it (sitting in /usr/share/doc/kdelibs-dev/dh-make) does very
little. The biggest job it has is to make sure that all the KDE variables are 
set properly for build...this includes a configure line.  

   If you place the debianrules script into your debian/ directory (if it 
doesn't already exist in admin/ or that one is a older version) you can modify
your debian/rules script to make use of it like so:



  configure: configure-stamp
 
  -include debian/debiandirs
 
  debian/debiandirs: debian/debianrules
          perl -w debian/debianrules echodirs > debian/debiandirs
 
  configure-stamp:
          dh_testdir

          ./configure $(configkde)


With this you can see we create a file called debian/debiandirs which contains
all the variables like kde_htmldir set to the proper Debian settings.  It
also sets up the configkde variable which currently looks like this:

    configkde=--disable-debug --disable-rpath --prefix=$(kde_prefix) --libexecdir=$(kde_bindir) --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt --mandir=$(mandir) --infodir=$(infodir)


You can add your custom configure bits after the $(configkde).  However 9 times
out of 10 you won't have to do a thing.


==================
Missing something?
==================

If there's something I'm missing from this document (and I'm sure there is)
please send mail off to debian-kde@lists.debian.org and I'll get it added
for future releases.  I'd like it if this could answer 99% of the questions
one might have about packaging up a KDE based app for Debian.
