1. About KDEDIR:
----------------

The debian KDE package has been modified so you do not need to set the
KDEDIR environment vairable to use it. You don't need to set QTDIR either.
However if you find that something really does need QTDIR you can set it
to /usr/share/qt and it'll be happy. 

2. Changes to KDE directory structure:
-------------------------------------

KDE's paths can mainly be organized independently. For Debian's sake,
I chose the below paths - following Andreas's settings.

/etc/kde3		kde config files (was KDE/share/config)
/usr			prefix
/usr/bin		kde binaries (was KDE/bin)
/usr/include/kde	kde include files (was KDE/include)
/usr/lib		kde shared libraries (was KDE/lib)
/usr/lib/cgi-bin	kde cgi binaries (was KDE/cgi-bin)
/usr/lib/kde3           kde module directory
/usr/share/applnk	kde applnk files (provide a link to /usr/share/applnk)
/usr/share/apps		kde per application directory
/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML kde online documentation (was KDE/share/doc)
/usr/share/icons	kde icons (and mini icons in .../icons/mini)
/usr/share/locale	locales
/usr/share/mimelnk	kde mimelink files
/usr/share/wallpapers	kde wallpaper icons (can also be used by other apps)

3. Kpanel and menus:
-------------------

If you have the menu package installed, kpanel will display the debian menus
of installed programs. Otherwise, you won't get any menus at all, so I do
recommend you install the menu package.

4. CUPS:
-------
It is possible to use cups printers from within kde,
without running a cupsd from cupsys on every machine.
to do this: create a ~/.cupsrc or /etc/cups/client.conf.

it could be as short as:
ServerName servername
Encryption Never

for a full example, see the client.conf from cupsys.

---

There used to be two versions of kde.deb : one made by debian, and 
one made by the KDE team. Fortunatly this has changed to the better
and this package is both: the debian package and the kde package.

Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@debian.org> used to maintain the debian part
and Stephan Kulow took them over, when he orphaned them. Then Ivan
Moore took them over.  Now, I (Chris) maintain them.

Thanks to Brandon Mitchell <bhmit1@mail.wm.edu> for his work on the
libc5 version.
