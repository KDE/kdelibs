  * back to using the paths out of debianrules with some dependency trick
    in rules. No more hardcoded paths there
  * don't use kderc file, but add the paths that are known to be 
    nonstandard in rules. And install into $kde_confdir/system.kdeglobals
    /etc/kderc may be used for the noncvs version later. For now it asks
    for trouble in my eyes :)
  * some changes in debianrules to make it more flexible too
  * don't compile with --enable-debug, but with --disable-debug - this does
    more than removing -g, don't know who made this policy within debian
  * use --enable-final as it makes thinks smaller, faster and better anyway ;)
