KDE Image I/O library
---------------------
This library allows applications that use the Qt library to read and
write images in extra formats. Current formats include:

JPEG	<read>
XV	<read> <write>
EPS	<read> <write>
NETPBM	<incomplete>
PNG	<read> <write, only with newer libraries>
TIFF	<read>
KRL	<read>

To use these formats, you must 

1. link the application with the libkimgio library
2. Include the <kimageio.h> header
3. call KImageIO::registerFormats() once, somewhere in your code
   before you load an image.


Writing handlers
----------------
Please read the documentation for the QImageIO class in the Qt
documentation.

1. When writing handlers, there is a function naming convention;
suppose, for example, we were writing PNG read and write handlers,
we would name them

void kimgio_png_read ( QImageIO * );
void kimgio_png_write( QImageIO * );

ie

kimgio_<format>_<read/write>

This should reduce the chance of identifier clashes with other code.

2. If you only have either a reader or the writer for a particular
format, don't use NULL in QImageIO::defineIOHandler. Instead, write
a stub function for the unimplemented handler which displays a message
on standard output. This prevents kimgio-using programs dumping core
when attempting to call the unimplemented handler.

Yours in good faith and pedantry,
