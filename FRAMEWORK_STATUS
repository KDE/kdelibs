KIO:

Sonnet:
Done -> (cullmann, moved to tier2/sonnet, as plugins) 

klauncher/ktoolinvocation:
 - KLauncher does startup notification, .desktop, and showing
  an error to the user if the application couldn't start.
  This is all in a separate process only to benefit from kdeinit.
 => remove klauncher, and use the KRun code (which uses QProcess and monitors)
  * showing errors to the user => done by KRun (see KProcessRunner)
  * startup notification       => done by KRun
 A) if we keep kdeinit, we only need to keep kdeinitExec in klauncher
 B) otherwise, we can make klauncher specific to kioslaves

To be done later when porting to frameworks:
Remove kinterprocesslock from the trash kioslave (KDBusInterProcessLock replaces it).
