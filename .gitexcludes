# This file is a global file to ignore things that probably shouldn't
# be committed to git.
#
# Its contents overrides (well, appends to) the per-repo glob exclusions.
# NOTE: that this obviously prevents these files from bein displayed in git
# status, git add --all, etc. etc. Since that's the point of it; that way you
# won't end up accidentally committing useless files/dirs, and cluttering
# your output from 'git status' for example.
#
# Feel free to add on to it.
#
# In order to use this file, copy it to ~/.gitexcludes, and add the
# following to your "~/.gitconfig" file.
#
# [core]
