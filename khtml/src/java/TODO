As of now, KJAS requires a Java 2 platform for classloading
and the default security manager.  If anyone wants to implement
a Java 1.1 security manager, please feel free and we can integrate
both versions.

- Get the keyboard focus issues fixed
- Fix khtml_part to have one applet context per Document
- add a context cache someplace so we can reload contexts-
  this will keep us from having to restart the jvm over
  and over- this is the biggest performance problem I think
- fix khtml_part so it will start and stop applets??
- Implement class loading via html proxies if one is set


- Use of QGuardedPointer
- LiveScript support
- Custom applet types
- Better support for Java 2
  - Use a factory to create the classloader and security managers
  - Use URLClassLoader- this is done
- Support for KIO URLs
