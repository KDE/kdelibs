Wynn Wilkes- November 14, 2000
I've just completed a large update that fixes a large number of bugs.  The
update also adds applet security.  The security update requires a Java 2
jvm.  

This is libkdejava, the KDE Java support library.

Directory map:

$CWD			CPP sources for KDE binding to KJAS and some
			additional utility classes.
kjava-classes.zip	An *uncompressed* ZIP file containing the .class files
			for the KJAS server. The files must be uncompressed to
			support some crappy JVMs.
org/kde/kjas/server	Java sources for KJAS server process
