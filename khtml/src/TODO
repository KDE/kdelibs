Here's what's still missing (without order):

Rendering:
	* text-align: Justify missing
	* allow font elements in a block level context.

StyleSheets:
	* @ rules in sheets
	* lots of properties
	* delete the old cssproperties in a style attribute in case
	  the style attribute changes.
	* border shorthand properties. Unspecified properties get their default
	  values. border-width: medium; border-color: undefined (== text color)

DOM:
	* some functions in the Impl classes
	* fix the set/retrieve functions, which use boolean values
	  -->> mostly done, still need to fix parseAttribute() calls	
	* DOM level 2
	* DOM stylesheets, changes need to trigger the appropriate changes
	  in the rendering tree
	* Implementation of NamedAttrMapImpl and Attributes in DOMElementImpl
	  is ugly. MOve aatributes to the elementImpl and make the namedNodeMap
	  point to an element. Think of creating AttrImpl's directly in
	  khtmltoken.cpp

XML:
	* lots of stuff in the Impl classes
	* parsing
	* entities
	* style sheet processing instructions
	* proper mimetype detection

misc:
	* <font size=+3> works as size=+1

Java:
	* support for the object element
	    --> mostly done
	* Java <--> HTMLWidget communication
	* turn kjava into a kpart

Attributes:
	* check for unimplemented attributes

Memory usage:
	* use bitfields for lots of things (especially in the
	  DOM/CSS/rendering stuff)
	* try to make better use of shared objects, especially in the
	  RenderStyle
	* check for leaks
	* there's a mem leak with the style objects of anonymous
	  boxes (and ListMarkers).

Other:
        * there's a bug on correctly retrieving <textarea> text.
          see test/forms.html and compare it with the way all other
          browsers handle that code
        * paste should be enabled (and implemented) if there's pasteable clipboard
          content and a form element has the focus
