     * Attr nodes; they always carry their children with them when imported.

     * If the deep option was set to true, the descendants of the source
     * element are recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to
     * form the corresponding subtree. Otherwise, this simply generates an
     * empty DocumentFragment.
     *
     * DOCUMENT_NODE
     * Document nodes cannot be imported.
     *
     * DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
     * DocumentType nodes cannot be imported.
     *
     * ELEMENT_NODE
     * Specified attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the
     * generated Attr nodes are attached to the generated Element. Default
     * attributes are not copied, though if the document being imported into
     * defines default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If
     * the importNode deep parameter was set to true, the descendants of the
     * source element are recursively imported and the resulting nodes
     * reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
     *
     * ENTITY_NODE
     * Entity nodes can be imported, however in the current release of the DOM
     * the DocumentType is readonly. Ability to add these imported nodes to a
     * DocumentType will be considered for addition to a future release of the
     * DOM.
     * On import, the publicId, systemId, and notationName attributes are
     * copied. If a deep import is requested, the descendants of the source
     * Entity are recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to
     * form the corresponding subtree.
     *
     * ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE Only the EntityReference itself is copied, even if
     * a deep import is requested, since the source and destination documents
     * might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
     * imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value is
     * assigned.
     *
     * NOTATION_NODE
     * Notation nodes can be imported, however in the current release of the
     * DOM the DocumentType is readonly. Ability to add these imported nodes to
     * a DocumentType will be considered for addition to a future release of
     * the DOM.
     * On import, the publicId and systemId attributes are copied.
     * Note that the deep parameter has no effect on Notation nodes since they
     * never have any children.
     *
     * PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE
     * The imported node copies its target and data values from those of the
     * source node.
     *
     * TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE
     * These three types of nodes inheriting from CharacterData copy their data
     * and length attributes from those of the source node.
     *
     * @param importedNode The node to import.
     *

/**
 * \c DocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal"
 * \c Document object. It is very common to want to be
 * able to extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new
 * fragment of a document. Imagine implementing a user command like
 * cut or rearranging a document by moving fragments around. It is
 * desirable to have an object which can hold such fragments and it is
 * quite natural to use a Node for this purpose. While it is true that
 * a \c Document object could fulfil this role, a
 * \c Document object can potentially be a heavyweight object,
 * depending on the underlying implementation. What is really needed
 * for this is a very lightweight object. \c DocumentFragment
 * is such an object.
 *
 *  Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as
 * children of another \c Node -- may take
 * \c DocumentFragment objects as arguments; this results in all
 * the child nodes of the \c DocumentFragment being moved
 * to the child list of this node.
 *
 *  The children of a \c DocumentFragment node are zero or
 * more nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the
 * structure of the document. \c DocumentFragment nodes do
 * not need to be well-formed XML documents (although they do need to
 * follow the rules imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities,
 * which can have multiple top nodes). For example, a
 * \c DocumentFragment might have only one child and that child
 * node could be a \c Text node. Such a structure model
 * represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML document.
 *
 *  When a \c DocumentFragment is inserted into a
 * \c Document (or indeed any other \c Node that may
 * take children) the children of the \c DocumentFragment
 * and not the \c DocumentFragment itself are inserted
 * into the \c Node . This makes the
 * \c DocumentFragment very useful when the user wishes to create
 * nodes that are siblings; the \c DocumentFragment acts
 * as the parent of these nodes so that the user can use the standard
 * methods from the \c Node interface, such as
 * \c insertBefore() and \c appendChild() .
