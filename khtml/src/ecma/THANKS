Vadim Plessky <lucy-ples@mtu-net.ru> for dissecting an endless number
of bug reports and therefore taking quite some load of our shoulders.

Ferdinand Gassauer <f.gassauer@aon.at> for numerous useful bug reports
and keeping track of them later.

David Faure <faure@kde.org> for taking some time off from Konqueror
and making a lotto site working fixing bugs along the way.
