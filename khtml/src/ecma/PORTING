Some porting notes for jscore work:

1) Some cases Null() or other garbage was used as the default in switch() where
it was returning Value().  Value() doesn't exist, we should return -null-
according to webcore.  This probably needs to be fixed.

2) Constructors for objects are probably quite broken.  Compare against webcore.

3) Lots of abort() were placed for functions and templates I couldn't find any
replacement for.

4) Replace this:
    Object err = Error::create(exec,TypeError);
    exec->setException(err);
    return err;
   with:
    throwError(exec, TypeError);

5) Replace getString() with ::getString()

6) Object::dynamicCast() (and others) are gone.  Use ->getObject() and friends
  and check for null instead of isValid().

7) .string() -> .domString()

8) double<->int conversions need to be fixed

9) ctx.sourceId() is gone

10) isA(x) ->  ->type() == x

11) DeclaredFunctionImp::setName is gone - what to do?
