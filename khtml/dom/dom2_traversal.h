 * Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If an

 * know anything about the data structure that is being iterated. This
 * makes it very easy to write filters, since the only thing they have
 * to know how to do is evaluate a single node. One filter may be used
 * with a number of different kinds of Iterators, encouraging code
 * reuse.

 * CustomNodeFilter which overrides the acceptNode() method and assign
 * an instance of it to the NodeFilter. For more details see the
