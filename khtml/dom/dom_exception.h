/**
 * DOM operations only raise exceptions in &quot;exceptional&quot;
 * circumstances, i.e., when an operation is impossible to perform
 * (either for logical reasons, because data is lost, or because the
 * implementation has become unstable). In general, DOM methods return
 * specific error values in ordinary processing situation, such as
 * out-of-bound errors when using \c NodeList .
 *
 *  Implementations may raise other exceptions under other
 * circumstances. For example, implementations may raise an
 * implementation-dependent exception if a \c null
 * argument is passed.
 *
 *  Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of
 * exceptions. For such systems, error conditions may be indicated
 * using native error reporting mechanisms. For some bindings, for
 * example, methods may return error codes similar to those listed in
 * the corresponding method descriptions.
