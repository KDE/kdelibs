/**
 * CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing
 * characters that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only
 * delimiter that is recognized in a CDATA section is the "]]&gt;"
 * string that ends the CDATA section. CDATA sections can not be
 * nested. The primary purpose is for including material such as XML
 * fragments, without needing to escape all the delimiters.
 *
 *  The <code> DOMString </code> attribute of the <code> Text </code>
 * node holds the text that is contained by the CDATA section. Note
 * that this may contain characters that need to be escaped outside of
 * CDATA sections and that, depending on the character encoding
 * ("charset") chosen for serialization, it may be impossible to write
 * out some characters as part of a CDATA section.
 *
 *  The <code> CDATASection </code> interface inherits the <code>
 * CharacterData </code> interface through the <code> Text </code>
 * interface. Adjacent <code> CDATASections </code> nodes are not
 * merged by use of the Element.normalize() method.

/**
 * This interface represents an entity, either parsed or unparsed, in
 * an XML document. Note that this models the entity itself not the
 * entity declaration. <code> Entity </code> declaration modeling has
 * been left for a later Level of the DOM specification.
 *
 *  The <code> nodeName </code> attribute that is inherited from
 * <code> Node </code> contains the name of the entity.
 *
 *  An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before
 * the structure model is passed to the DOM; in this case there will
 * be no <code> EntityReference </code> nodes in the document tree.
 *
 *  XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and
 * process entity declarations made in the external subset or declared
 * in external parameter entities. This means that parsed entities
 * declared in the external subset need not be expanded by some
 * classes of applications, and that the replacement value of the
 * entity may not be available. When the replacement value is
 * available, the corresponding <code> Entity </code> node's child
 * list represents the structure of that replacement text. Otherwise,
 * the child list is empty.
 *
 *  The resolution of the children of the <code> Entity </code> (the
 * replacement value) may be lazily evaluated; actions by the user
 * (such as calling the <code> childNodes </code> method on the <code>
 * Entity </code> Node) are assumed to trigger the evaluation.
 *
 *  The DOM Level 1 does not support editing <code> Entity </code>
 * nodes; if a user wants to make changes to the contents of an <code>
 * Entity </code> , every related <code> EntityReference </code> node
 * has to be replaced in the structure model by a clone of the <code>
 * Entity </code> 's contents, and then the desired changes must be
 * made to each of those clones instead. All the descendants of an
 * <code> Entity </code> node are readonly.
 *
 *  An <code> Entity </code> node does not have any parent.
