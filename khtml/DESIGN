README.parser
=============

This document gives a short explanation about the verious parsing stages
within the KHTML component.

When HTML is fed into KHTML it takes 3 stages before it is put onto the
screen:

Stage 1.: The Tokenizer.
Stage 2.: The HTML-Parser
Stage 3.: The HTML-Layout  

The Tokenizer
=============

The tokenizer is located in khtmltoken.cpp. The tokenizer uses the contents
of a HTML-file as input and breaks this contents up in a linked list of 
tokens. The tokenizer recognizes HTML-entities and HTML-tags. Text between
begin- and end-tags is handled distinctly for several tags. The distinctions
are in the way how spaces, linefeeds, HTLM-entities and other tags are
handled. 

Example I: 
Normally linefeeds are treated like spaces. However, inside a <pre> tag
linefeeds are preserved.

Example II:
Normally all text is translated into tokens and added to the linked list to
be fed into the HTML-Parser. However, text within the <script> tag is fed
into a script-interpreter. (Not that any is available at the moment).

The tokenizer is completly state-driven on a character by character base.
All text passed over to the tokenizer is directly tokenized. A complete
HTML-file can be passed to the tokenizer as a whole, character by character
(not very efficient) or in blocks of any (variable) size.


The HTML-Parser
===============

The HTML-parser interprets the stream of tokens provided by the tokenizer
and constructs a structure of renderable elements. Two types of renderable
elements can be distinguished: HTML-objects and HTML-clues.

* HTML-objects

A HTML-object is a object which can be drawn on the screen. Examples of it
are text, links, images and lines.

* HTML-clues

A HTML-clue is a container which can contain HTML-objects and/or other
HTML-clues. A HTML-clue determines how the elements which it contains are
positioned with respect to each other.

Example I:
The HTMLClueFlow positions its elements in a 'flow' like the text in a book: 
It starts from the left and moves to the right. When it hits the
right-margin it moves down and continues from the left-margin.  

The HTML-Layout
===============

When the complete structure of HTML-clues and HTML-objects is build. The
HTML-layout starts: each HTML-object is positioned. The positioning depends
on the available screen-width.

The positioning starts with the calculation of the minimum screen-width
required to display the complete HTML page. The calcMinSize method in
HTML-clues and HTML-objects is used for this. The minimum size is calculated
recursively through all HTML-clues.

When the minimum size is known it compared against the actuaal available
screen-size. If the minimum size is less than the available
screen-size the available screen size will be used as the maximum screen
size. If the minimum size is greater than the available size the minimum
size is used as the maximum screen size. In taht case, if configured, a 
horizontal scrollbar will be added to be able to scroll.

The HTMLText objects
====================

There are several text-related objects:

   HTMLHSpace: A horizontal space
   HTMLVSpace: A vertical space, e.g. linefeed
   HTMLText: A non-breakable text object
   HTMLTextMaster: A breakable text-object
   HTMLLinkText: A non-breakable hyperlinked text object
   HTMLLinkTextMaster: A breakable hyperlinked text object
 
   Use:
      HTMLHSpace is equivalent to HTMLText(" ", ...) but slightly smaller
                 in memory usage
      HTMLVSpace is used for a forced line-break (e.g. linefeed)
      HTMLText is used for text which shouldn't be broken.
      HTMLTextMaster is used for text which may be broken on spaces,
                 it should only be used inside HTMLClueFlow.
                 For text without spaces HTMLTextMaster is equivalent
                 to HTMLText. In such cases HTMLText is more efficient.
      HTMLLinkText is like HTMLText but can be hyperlinked.
      HTMLLinkTextMaster is like HTMLTextMaster but can be hyperlinked.
  
   Rationale:
      Basically all functionality is provided by HTMLVSpace and HTMLText.
      The additional functionality of HTMLLLinkText is not put in HTMLText
      to keep the memory usage of the frequently used HTMLText object low.
      Since often single spaces are used in HTML, they got their own, even
      smaller object.
      Another often encountered pattern is a paragraph of text. The
      HTMLTextMaster is designed for this purpose. It splits the paragraph
      in lines during layout and allocates a HTMLTextSlave object for each
      line. The actual text itself is maintained by the HTMLTextMaster
      object making efficient memory usage possible.


The HTMLTextMaster/HTMLTextSlave objects
========================================

Text sequences rendered with the same font-settings are kept in one single 
string as much as possible. If such a string contains normal (breaking) 
spaces, this string is converted into a HTMLTextMaster object. If such a 
string contains non-breaking spaces it is converted into a HTMLText object.
The non-breaking spaces are passed as normal spaces to the HTMLText object, 
since the HTMLText object does never break up any text, the spaces act as 
non-breaking spaces.

If a string contains both breaking and non-breaking spaces the string is 
split up across a HTMLText, HTMLSpace and HTMLTextMaster object. The reason
for this is that we can't pass non-breaking spaces to the HTMLTextMaster
object due to problems with fonts. Not all fonts print the character
0xA0. A workaround in Qt is announced. Until that workaround is mainstream,
we can't use non-breaking spaces in our HTMLTextMaster object.

The actual line-breaking is done in the HTMLTextSlave::fitLine() method. This 
method is called from HTMLClueFlow::calcSize().
The parent of the HTMLTextSlave should be the HTMLClueFlow object. 

In HTMLClue is also a call to fitLine(). This call has its arguments setup to 
instruct the HTMLTextSlave not to do any breaking at all. HTMLClue is used
for the contents of <pre>..</pre> tags. It is rather strange if HTMLClue 
contains any HTMLTextSlave objects though. Text within <pre>..</pre> tags 
should all end up as HTMLText objects.

The line breaking is pretty tricky. This is how it is done without any 
HTMLTextMaster objects (e.g. without fitLine functionality)

The HTMLTextMaster object contains the text string. During lay-out the 
HTMLTextMaster spawns off a HTMLTextSlave which prints (a part of) the 
text string. All layout issues are further handled by HTMLTextSlave.

Basic Text lay-out
==================

Basically the line-breaking is done by
HTMLClueFlow::calcSize(). It lays out the text line by line. It collects 
"run"'s of objects. A "run" is a sequence of objects with no white-space 
inbetween them. If a run is complete it is checked whether the width of the 
run fits the current line. If it fits another run is made until no more run 
can be added: the line is full. The last run which didn't fit anymore on 
the line is rejected.

If we have line consisting og a set of run's which fit the current width 
of the HTMLClueFlow we have to check whether the total available space at 
the point where we are expecting the text is indeed enough for our line.

This seems redundant but although the width of the Clue is big enough to 
hold the line it can be that a floating images is right beneath us and that 
we therefor have not enough space for the height of the line. If this is the 
case we ask for a new position (further down in the Clue) which provides 
enough height for our line. Since this position may have a different width, we 
throw away our line and start making a new line given the new width.

This isn't very efficient but it shouldn't occur too often.


Text layout using fitLine().
============================

The text-layout algorithm mentioned above assumes that all objects (making 
up the runs) have a fixed width wich can't be changed. The HTMLTextSlave
objects however, can break themselve up in multiple HTMLTextSlave objects.

The fitLine() call is a hint to the HTMLTextSlave object to break itself up
if necassery. After it has done so (or if it chooses not to do so) the 
HTMLTextSlave is further treated by the text-layout algorithm as a normal 
fixed size object. 

For efficiency the fitLine() function returns some information to the 
text-layout algorithm. If HTMLTextSlave has broken itself up it makes no 
sense to try to add more objects to that line. The next object will be the 
remaining part of the HTMLTextSlave, if it would have fitted, the original 
HTMLTextSlave would had splitted in the first place. So if HTMLPartialFit 
is returned, this is a hint to the layout-algorithm that with thi HTMLTextSlave 
the line is full and that it doesn't need to try to add more objects to that 
line.
 
Another possibily is that the HTMLTextSlave sees no way to break itself so 
that it fits the available space. In that case it does no further attempt
and returns HTMLNoFit to the layout algorithm. This is an indication that the
run the HTMLTextSlave is part of, will not fit the available space and that it
is useless to try any further.

An exception to this rule is the case where this run is the first run of the 
line. In that case the HTMLTextSlave should make itself as small as possible. 
The resulting run will then not fit within the width of the current line. 
However, another position for the text is searched where the line does fit. 

If such a position is not found the widest available position is choosen. 
In this case the text will overflow the Clue borders. This should only be 
possible to happen if the width of the Clue didn't take (for some reason 
or the other) the minimumWidth of its contents into account.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically all strings used in a page are allocated through the tokenizer. 
Strings passed to HTMLObjects are used as provided, no copy is
made. The caller should ensure that the passed strings remain allocated during
the lifetime of the HTMLObject. The simplest way to do that is to allocate the
string through the tokenizer. All strings allocated this way are deleted when
a new page is being loaded.

By deleting the HTMLObjects before deleting the tokenizer, we ensure that the
strings will not be used after they have been deleted.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clue nesting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following parent-child relations can exist:

   Parent      |   Child
---------------+----------------
  HTMLClueV    |  HTMLClueH
     ,,        |  HTMLClueFlow
               |
  HTMLClueH    |  HTMLClueV
               |
 HTMLClueFlow  |  HTMLClueAligned
     ,,        |  (objects)
               |
HTMLClueAligned|  (objects)
               |


All but HTMLClueH's last children should have a fixed width, 
it's last child may have any kind of width.
