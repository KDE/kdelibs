these are additional cmake modules required for compiling KDE3 or KDE4
applications with cmake. Some of them are enhanced versions of the files 
coming with cmake, some of them are NOT yet part of cmake.
To use them, copy them into the cmake Module directory or
run "cmake ."  followed by "make install"

Changes to any files should follow the 

cmake commit policy 

    at http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/CMake_Commit_Policy

and the cmake coding style
