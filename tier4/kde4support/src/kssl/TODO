- KSSLServer class needs to be written (in a separate lib!!) so that an app
  can act as an SSL server.

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.
  This should be a separate app I guess, and can include a CA signer even.

- KDE4 - fix constness and reference arguments

- CRL support (not much left to do?)

- Code checking for OCX.  

- KSSLD should emit dcop signals to tell people when things change

- <keygen> is not working.

- Namespace it all to KIO::SSL:: in KDE4

- Remove SSLv2

- Fix ksslcalist and any code that uses subject/issuer name as provided by
  openssl since this is broken by design.  Use MD5 sum for indexing the database
  instead
