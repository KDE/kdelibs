 * the class that does the actual work.
 *
 * In the future, this class might be exposed to allow plug-ins. So, try and 
 * make it binary compatible.
 *
 * Note that hostnames are still encoded in Unicode at this point. It's up to
 * the worker class to decide which encoding to use. In the case of DNS, 
 * an ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) must be used. 
 * See KResolver::domainToAscii().
 *
 * Also specially note that the run method in this class is called in a
 * thread that is not the program's main thread. So do not do anything there
 * that you shouldn't!
