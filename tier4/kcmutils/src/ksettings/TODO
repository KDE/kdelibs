- KPluginSelct.. listview should only show the name and comment, the rest is
  shown in a tooltip (I don't know how to get the tooltip working in the
  listview.)
- Handle unsaved changes in KCMs that are hidden if the user deselects some
  plugin KCMs (in KSettings::Dialog::Configurable mode). Ideas:
  - don't allow changes to the plugin selection if there are unsaved changes in
    the main dlg ("You have unsaved changes in the configuration dialog, please
    save them first before changing the components selection.")
  - automatically save changes of hidden modules when the dialog is deleted
  - ask as soon as KCMultiDialog can detect that there are unsaved changes to
    hidden KCMs (it might even be possible to show the KCMs for that)
