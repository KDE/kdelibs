/**
 * The \c Attr interface represents an attribute in an
 * \c Element object. Typically the allowable values for
 * the attribute are defined in a document type definition.
 *
 *  \c Attr objects inherit the \c Node
 * interface, but since they are not actually child nodes of the
 * element they describe, the DOM does not consider them part of the
 * document tree. Thus, the \c Node attributes
 * \c parentNode , \c previousSibling , and
 * \c nextSibling have a null value for \c Attr
 * objects. The DOM takes the view that attributes are properties of
 * elements rather than having a separate identity from the elements
 * they are associated with; this should make it more efficient to
 * implement such features as default attributes associated with all
 * elements of a given type. Furthermore, \c Attr nodes
 * may not be immediate children of a \c DocumentFragment
 * . However, they can be associated with \c Element nodes
 * contained within a \c DocumentFragment . In short,
 * users and implementors of the DOM need to be aware that \c Attr
 * nodes have some things in common with other objects
 * inheriting the \c Node interface, but they also are
 * quite distinct.
 *
 *  The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this
 * attribute has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the
 * attribute's effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration
 * for this attribute, and that declaration includes a default value,
 * then that default value is the attribute's effective value;
 * otherwise, the attribute does not exist on this element in the
 * structure model until it has been explicitly added. Note that the
 * \c nodeValue attribute on the \c Attr
 * instance can also be used to retrieve the string version of the
 * attribute's value(s).
 *
 *  In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity
 * references, the child nodes of the \c Attr node provide
 * a representation in which entity references are not expanded. These
 * child nodes may be either \c Text or
 * \c EntityReference nodes. Because the attribute type may be
 * unknown, there are no tokenized attribute values.
