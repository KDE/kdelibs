// KJS_MEM_LIMIT and KJS_MEM_INCREMENT can be tweaked to adjust how the
// garbage collector allocates memory. KJS_MEM_LIMIT is the largest # of objects
// the collector will allow to be present in memory. Once this limit is reached,
// a running script will get an "out of memory" exception.
//
// KJS_MEM_INCREMENT specifies the amount by which the "soft limit" on memory is
// increased when the memory gets filled up. The soft limit is the amount after
// which the GC will run and delete unused objects.
//
// If you are debugging seemingly random crashes where an object has been deleted,
// try setting KJS_MEM_INCREMENT to something small, e.g. 300, to force garbage
// collection to happen more often, and disable the softLimit increase &
// out-of-memory testing code in Collector::allocate()
