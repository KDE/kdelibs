/** @mainpage DNSSD

<p>DNSSD is a library for handling the DNS-based Service Discovery Protocol (DNS-SD),
the layer of <a href="http://www.zeroconf.org">Zeroconf</a> that allows network
services, such as printers, to be discovered without any user intervention or
centralized infrastructure.</p>

Apple's implementation of Zeroconf is
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/bonjour.html">Bonjour</a>.
Apple's developer documentation provides lots of information about Bonjour
in its <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Articles/about.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002458-SW1">Bonjour overview</a>.

If you are writing an application that wants to discover services on the network,
use DNSSD::ServiceBrowser.  You can also find available service types using ServiceTypeBrowser.

If you want to announce the availability of a service provided by your application,
use DNSSD::PublicService.

DNSSD::DomainBrowser allows you to find domains (other than the local one) recommended
for browsing or publishing to.

Note that DNSSD::ServiceBrowser::isAvailable() provides information about the availability
of the services provided by this library generally, not just for browsing services.
