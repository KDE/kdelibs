   * is selected, then you can achieve this using ActionLists. It
   * works as follows:
   * In your xxxui.rc file ( the one that you set in @ref setXMLFile()
   * ), you put an <ActionList name="xxx"> tag.  E.g.
   * \verbatim
   * <kpartgui name="xxx_part" version="1">
   * <MenuBar>
   *   <Menu name="file">
   *     ...  <!-- some useful actions-->
   *     <ActionList name="xxx_file_actionlist" />
   *     ...  <!-- even more useful actions-->
   *   </Menu>
   *   ...
   * </MenuBar>
   * </kpartgui>
   * \endverbatim
   *
   * This tag will get expanded to a list of actions.  In the example
   * above ( a file manager with a dynamic file menu ), you would call
   * \code
   * QPtrList<KAction> file_actions;
   * for( ... )
   *   if( ... )
   *     file_actions.append( cool_action );
   * unplugActionList( "xxx_file_actionlist" );
   * plugActionList( "xxx_file_actionlist", file_actions );
   * \endcode
   * every time a file is selected, unselected or ...
   *
   * \note You should not call createGUI() after calling this
   *       function.  In fact, that would remove the newly added
   *       actionlists again...
   * \note Forgetting to call unplugActionList() before
   *       plugActionList() would leave the previous actions in the
   *       menu too..
