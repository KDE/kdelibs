 * This Widget extends the functionality of QListView to honor the system
 * wide settings for Single Click/Double Click mode, AutoSelection and
 * ChangeCursorOverLink (TM).
 *
 * There is a new signal executed(). It gets connected to either
 * @ref QListView::clicked() or  @ref QListView::doubleClicked() depending on the KDE
 * wide Single Click/Double Click settings. It is strongly recommended that
 * you use this signal instead of the above mentioned. This way you don´t
 * need to care about the current settings.
 * If you want to get informed when the user selects something connect to the
 * QListView::selectionChanged() signal.
 *
 * Drag-and-Drop is supported with the signal @ref #dropped(), just @ref #setAcceptDrops(true)
 * and connect it to a suitable slot.
 * To see where you are dropping, @ref setDropVisualizer(true).
 * And also you'll need @ref acceptDrag(QDropEvent*)
 *
 * KListView is drag-enabled, too: to benefit from that you've got derive from it.
 * Reimplement @ref dragObject() and (possibly) @ref startDrag(),
 * and @ref setDragEnabled(true).
