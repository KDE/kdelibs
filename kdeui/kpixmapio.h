/**
 * @short Fast QImage to/from QPixmap conversion.
 * @author Geert Jansen <jansen@kde.org>
 * @version $Id$
 *
 * KPixmapIO implements a fast path for QPixmap to/from QImage conversions.
 * It uses the MIT-SHM shared memory extension for this. If this extension is
 * not available, it will fall back to standard Qt methods.
 *
 * @sect Typical usage
 *
 * You can use KPixmapIO for load/saving pixmaps.
 *
 * <pre>
 * KPixmapIO io;
 * pixmap = io.convertToPixmap(image);
 * image = io.convertToImage(pixmap);
 * </pre>
 *
 * It also has functionality for partially updating/saving pixmaps, see
 * @ref #putImage and @ref #getImage.
 *
 * @sect KPixmapIO vs. Qt speed comparison
 *
 * Speed measurements were taken. These show that usage of KPixmapIO for
 * images up to a certain threshold size, offers no speed advantage over
 * the Qt routines. Below you can see a plot of these measurements.
 *
 * @image html kpixmapio-perf.png "Performance of KPixmapIO"
 *
 * The threshold size, amongst other causes, is determined by the shared
 * memory allocation policy. If the policy is @p ShmDontKeep, the
 * shared memory segment is discarded right after usage, and thus needs to
 * be allocated before each transfer. This introduces a a setup penalty not
 * present when the policy is @p ShmKeepAndGrow. In this case the
 * shared memory segment is kept and resized when necessary, until the
 * KPixmapIO object is destroyed.
 *
 * The default policy is @p ShmDontKeep. This policy makes sense when
 * loading pixmaps once. The corresponding threshold is taken at 5.000
 * pixels as suggested by experiments. Below this threshold, KPixmapIO
 * will not use shared memory and fall back on the Qt routines.
 *
 * When the policy is @p ShmKeepAndGrow, the threshold is taken at
 * 2.000 pixels. Using this policy, you might want to use @ref #preAllocShm
 * to pre-allocate a certain amount of shared memory, in order to avoid
 * resizes. This allocation policy makes sense in a multimedia type
 * application where you are constantly updating the screen.
 *
 * Above a couple times the threshold size, KPixmapIO's and Qt's speed become
 * linear in the number of pixels, KPixmapIO being at least 2, and mostly around
 * 4 times faster than Qt, depending on the screen and image depth.
 *
 * Speed difference seems to be the most at 16 bpp, followed by 32 and 24
 * bpp respectively. This can be explained by the relatively poor
 * implementation of 16 bit RGB packing in Qt, while at 32 bpp we need to
 * transfer more data, and thus gain more, than at 24 bpp.
 *
 * @sect Conclusion
 *
 * For large pixmaps, there's a definite speed improvement when using
 * KPixmapIO. On the other hand, there's no speed improvement for small
 * pixmaps. When you know you're only transferring small pixmaps, there's no
 * point in using it.
