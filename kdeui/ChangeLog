	* kquickhelp.*: changed 'tips' to be a pointer instead of an object.
	This fixes the segfaults on HP/UX and probably the ones on NetBSD.

	* kmenubar.h: Fix up some of the comments so they're gramatically
	correct and make a bit more sense.  Make private members protected, 
	in the spirit of reusable code.
