	* keditcl1.cpp: i18n'ed "Untitled" (Save As ... bug)
	* keditcl2.cpp: gave QMessageBox'es more appropriate parents

	* kquickhelp.*: changed 'tips' to be a pointer instead of an object.
	This fixes the segfaults on HP/UX and probably the ones on NetBSD.
	* kquickhelp.*: use setuid()/setgid() instead of the not-so-portable
	seteuid()/setegid() pair. Reversed the order, too.

	* kmenubar.h: Fix up some of the comments so they're gramatically
	correct and make a bit more sense.  Make private members protected, 
	in the spirit of reusable code.
