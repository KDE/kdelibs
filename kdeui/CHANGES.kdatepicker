February 25 1998:
The buttons that switch the month no more display "<--" and "-->" but 
arrow bitmaps that look much nicer.

March 17 1998:
I added the two methods setDate(QDate) and QSize sizeHint() to 
KDatePicker.

March 27 1998:
I added some documentation to the both header files and cleaned up 
some code. No functional changes.

April 13 1998:
No changes, but Preston Brown tested the sources in korganizer without
problems. I will send them to Kalle to check it in.

May 28 1998:
I got a patch from Andreas "highstick" Hochsteger, he added yearwise up 
and down buttons. I was very happy as I intended to do the same, and 
now he did. It looks good.

Aug 21 1998:
Added the method for setting the font size.
