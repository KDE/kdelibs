/**
 * Word-wrap algorithm that takes into account beautifulness ;)
 *
 * That means:
 * @li not letting a letter alone on the last line,
 * @li breaking at punctuation signs (not only at spaces)
 * @li improved handling of (), [] and {}
 * @li improved handling of '/' (e.g. for paths)
 *
 * Usage: call the static method, formatText, with the text to
 * wrap and the constraining rectangle etc., it will return an instance of KWordWrap
 * containing internal data, result of the word-wrapping.
 * From that instance you can retrieve the boundingRect, and invoke drawing.
 *
 * This design allows to call the word-wrap algorithm only when the text changes
 * and not every time we want to know the bounding rect or draw the text.
