/**
 * This class simplifies handling of X errors. It shouldn't be necessary to use
 * with Qt classes, as the toolkit should handle X errors itself, so this
 * class will be mainly used with direct Xlib usage, and some lowlevel classes
 * like NETWinInfo.
 *
 * The usual usage is to create a KXErrorHandler instance right before starting
 * operations that might cause X errors, and checking if there was an error
 * by calling error() after the operations are finished. The handlers
 * may be nested, but must be destroyed in reverse order they were created.
 *
 * There's no need to do X sync before creating an instance, every instance
 * will handle only errors for request issued after the instance was created.
 * Errors for older requests will be passed to previous error handler.
 * When checking for error by calling error() at the end, it is necessary
 * to sync with X, to catch all errors that were caused by requests issued
 * before the call to error(). This can be done by passing true to error()
 * to cause explicit XSync(), however, if the last X request needed a roundtrip
 * (e.g. XGetWindowAttributes(), XGetGeometry(), etc.), it is not required
 * to do an explicit sync.
