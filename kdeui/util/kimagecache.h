/**
 * @brief A simple wrapping layer over KSharedDataCache to support caching
 * images and pixmaps.
 *
 * This class can be used to share images between different processes, which
 * is useful when it is known that such images will be used across many
 * processes, or when creating the image is expensive.
 *
 * In addition, the class also supports caching QPixmaps <em>in a single
 * process</em> using the setPixmapCaching() function.
 *
 * Tips for use: If you already have QPixmaps that you intend to use, and
 * you do not need access to the actual image data, then try to store and
 * retrieve QPixmaps for use.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you will need to store and retrieve actual image
 * data (to modify the image after retrieval for instance) then you should
 * use QImage to save the conversion cost from QPixmap to QImage.
 *
 * KImageCache is a subclass of KSharedDataCache, so all of the methods that
 * can be used with KSharedDataCache can be used with KImageCache,
 * <em>with the exception of KSharedDataCache::insert() and
 * KSharedDataCache::find()</em>.
