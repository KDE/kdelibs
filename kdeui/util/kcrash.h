/**
 * This namespace contains functions to handle crashes.
 * It allows you to set a crash handler function that will be called
 * when your application crashes and also provides a default crash
 * handler that implements the following functionality:
 * @li Launches the KDE crash display application (DrKonqi) to let
 * the user report the bug and/or debug it.
 * @li Calls an emergency save function that you can set with
 * setEmergencySaveFunction() to attempt to save the application's data.
 * @li Autorestarts your application.
 *
 * @note All the above features are optional and you need to enable them
 * explicitly. By default, the defaultCrashHandler() will not do anything.
 * However, if you are using KApplication, it will by default enable launching
 * DrKonqi on crashes, unless the --nocrashhandler argument was passed on
 * the command line or the environment variable KDE_DEBUG is set to any value.
