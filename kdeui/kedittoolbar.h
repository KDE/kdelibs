/**
 * This is a dialog used to customize or configure toolbars.
 *
 * This dialog only works if your application uses the XML UI
 * framework for creating menus and toolbars.  It depends on the XML
 * files to describe the toolbar layouts and it requires the actions
 * to determine which buttons are active.
 *
 * Typically, you would include the @ref KStdAction::configureToolbars()
 * standard action in your application.  In your slot to this action,
 * you would have something like so:
 *
 * <pre>
 * KEditToolbar dlg(actionCollection());
 * if (dlg.exec())
 * {
 *   createGUI();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * That code snippet also takes care of redrawing the menu and
 * toolbars if you have made any changes.
 *
 * If you are using KMainWindow's settings methods (either save/apply manually
 * or autoSaveSettings), you should write something like:
 * <pre>
 * void MyClass::slotConfigureToolbars()
 * {
 *   saveMainWindowSettings( KGlobal::config(), "MainWindow" );
 *   KEditToolbar dlg(actionCollection());
 *   connect(&dlg,SIGNAL(newToolbarConfig()),this,SLOT(slotNewToolbarConfig()));
 *   if (dlg.exec())
 *   {
 *      createGUI();
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::slotNewToolbarConfig() // This is called when OK or Apply is clicked
 * {
 *    ...if you use any action list, use plugActionList on each here...
 *    applyMainWindowSettings( KGlobal::config(), "MainWindow" );
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that the procedure is a bit different for KParts applications.
 * In this case, you need only pass along a pointer to your
 * application's @ref KXMLGUIFactory object.  The editor will take care of
 * finding all of the action collections and xml files.  The editor
 * aims to be semi-intelligent about where it assigns any
 * modifications.  In other words, it will not write out part specific
 * changes to your shell's xml file.
 *
 * An example would be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * saveMainWindowSettings( KGlobal::config(), "MainWindow" );
 * KEditToolbar dlg(factory());
 * connect(&dlg,SIGNAL(newToolbarConfig()),this,SLOT(slotNewToolbarConfig()));
 * dlg.exec(); // Note that you shouldn't call createGUI(), so if() might not be even needed anymore
 *
 * ... // See above for slotNewToolbarConfig
 * </pre>
