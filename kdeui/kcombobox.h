/**
 * A combined button, line-edit and a popup list widget.
 *
 * \b Detail \n
 *
 * This widget inherits from QComboBox and implements the following
 * additional functionalities:  a completion object that provides both automatic
 * and manual text completion as well as text rotation features, configurable
 * key-bindings to activate these features, and a popup-menu item that can be
 * used to allow the user to change the text completion mode on the fly.
 *
 * To support these new features KComboBox emits a few additional signals
 * such as completion( const QString& ) and textRotation( KeyBindgingType ).
 * The completion signal can be connected to a slot that will assist the user in
 * filling out the remaining text while the rotation signal can be used to traverse
 * through all possible matches whenever text completion results in multiple matches.
 * Additionally, a returnPressed() and a returnPressed( const QString& )
 * signals are emitted when the user presses the Enter/Return key.
 *
 * KCombobox by default creates a completion object when you invoke the
 * completionObject( bool ) member function for the first time or
 * explicitly use setCompletionObject( KCompletion*, bool ) to assign your
 * own completion object.  Additionally, to make this widget more functional,
 * KComboBox will by default handle text rotation and completion events
 * internally whenever a completion object is created through either one of the
 * methods mentioned above.  If you do not need this functionality, simply use
 * KCompletionBase::setHandleSignals(bool) or alternatively set the boolean
 * parameter in the @p setCompletionObject call to false.
 *
 * The default key-bindings for completion and rotation is determined from the
 * global settings in KStdAccel. These values, however, can be overridden
 * locally by invoking KCompletionBase::setKeyBinding(). The values can
 * easily be reverted back to the default setting, by simply calling
 * useGlobalSettings(). An alternate method would be to default individual
 * key-bindings by usning setKeyBinding() with the default second argument.
 *
 * A non-editable combobox only has one completion mode, @p CompletionAuto.
 * Unlike an editable combobox the CompletionAuto mode, works by matching 
 * any typed key with the first letter of entries in the combobox. Please note
 * that if you call setEditable( false ) to change an editable combobox to a
 * non-editable one, the text completion object associated with the combobox will
 * no longer exist unless you created the completion object yourself and assigned
 * it to this widget or you called setAutoDeleteCompletionObject( false ). In other
 * words do not do the following:
 *
 * \code
 * KComboBox* combo = new KCompletionBox(true, this, "mywidget");
 * KCompletion* comp = combo->completionObject();
 * combo->setEditable( false );
 * comp->clear(); // CRASH: completion object does not exist anymore. 
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * A read-only KComboBox will have the same background color as a 
 * disabled KComboBox, but its foreground color will be the one used for
 * the read-write mode. This differs from QComboBox's implementation
 * and is done to give visual distinction between the three different modes: 
 * disabled, read-only, and read-write.
 * 
 * \b Usage \n
 *
 * To enable the basic completion feature:
 *
 * \code
 * KComboBox *combo = new KComboBox( true, this, "mywidget" );
 * KCompletion *comp = combo->completionObject();
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(combo,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&)));
 *
 * // Provide the to be completed strings. Note that those are separate from the combo's
 * // contents.
 * comp->insertItems( someQStringList );
 * \endcode
 *
 * To use your own completion object:
 *
 * \code
 * KComboBox *combo = new KComboBox( this,"mywidget" );
 * KURLCompletion *comp = new KURLCompletion();
 * combo->setCompletionObject( comp );
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(combo,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that you have to either delete the allocated completion object
 * when you don't need it anymore, or call
 * setAutoDeleteCompletionObject( true );
 *
 * Miscellaneous function calls:
 *
 * \code
 * // Tell the widget not to handle completion and rotation
 * combo->setHandleSignals( false );
 * // Set your own completion key for manual completions.
 * combo->setKeyBinding( KCompletionBase::TextCompletion, Qt::End );
 * // Hide the context (popup) menu
 * combo->setContextMenuEnabled( false );
 * \endcode
 *
 * @short An enhanced combo box.
