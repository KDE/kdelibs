/**
 * A QXEmbed widget serves as an embedder that can manage one single embedded
 * X-window. These so-called client windows can be arbitrary Qt or non Qt
 * applications.
 *
 * There are two different ways of using QXEmbed,
 * from the client side or from the embedder's side.
 * 
 * Embedding from the client's side requires that the client knows the
 * window identifier of the respective embedder widget. Use either
 * embedClientIntoWindow() or the high-level wrapper processClientCmdline().
 * This is only possible when the client is a Qt application.
 *
 * When using it from the embedder's side, you must know the window 
 * identifier of the window that should be embedded. Simply call embed() 
 * with this identifier as parameter.  If the client is a Qt application,
 * make sure it has called QXEmbed::initialize(). Otherwise you should
 * probably call setProtocol(XPLAIN) before embed().
 * 
 * Reimplement the change handler windowChanged() to catch embedding or
 * the destruction of embedded windows. In the latter case, the
 * embedder also emits a signal embeddedWindowDestroyed() for
 * convenience.
 *
 * @short The QXEmbed widget is a graphical socket that can embed an external X-Window.
