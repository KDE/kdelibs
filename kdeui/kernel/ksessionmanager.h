/**
   Provides highlevel access to session management on a per-object
   base.

   KSessionManager makes it possible to provide implementations for
 QApplication::commitData() and QApplication::saveState(), without
   subclassing KApplication. KMainWindow internally makes use of this.

   You don't need to do anything with this class when using
   KMainWindow. Instead, use KMainWindow::saveProperties(),
 KMainWindow::readProperties(), KMainWindow::queryClose(),
 KMainWindow::queryExit() and friends.
