/**
 * @short A dialog used to customize or configure toolbars.
 *
 * This dialog only works if your application uses the XML UI
 * framework for creating menus and toolbars.  It depends on the XML
 * files to describe the toolbar layouts and it requires the actions
 * to determine which buttons are active.
 *
 * Typically you do not need to use it directly as KXmlGuiWindow::setupGUI
 * takes care of it.
 *
 * If you use plugListAction you need to overload saveNewToolbarConfig()
 * to plug actions again:
 *
 * \code
 * void MyClass::saveNewToolbarConfig()
 * {
 *   KXmlGuiWindow::saveNewToolbarConfig();
 *   plugActionList( "list1", list1Actions );
 *   plugActionList( "list2", list2Actions );
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * When created, KEditToolBar takes a KXMLGUIFactory object, and uses it to
 * find all of the action collections and XML files (there is one of each for the
 * mainwindow, but there could be more, when adding other XMLGUI clients like
 * KParts or plugins). The editor aims to be semi-intelligent about where it
 * assigns any modifications. In other words, it will not write out part specific
 * changes to your application's main XML file.
 *
 * KXmlGuiWindow and KParts::MainWindow take care of creating KEditToolBar correctly
 * and connecting to its newToolBarConfig slot, but if you really really want to do it
 * yourself, see the KXmlGuiWindow::configureToolbars() and KXmlGuiWindow::saveNewToolbarConfig() code.
