/**
 *  KDE System Tray Window class
 *
 * This class implements system tray windows.
 *
 * A tray window is a small window (typically 24x24 pixel) that docks
 * into the system tray in the desktop panel. It usually displays an
 * icon or an animated icon there. The icon serves as representative
 * for the application, similar to a taskbar button, but consumes less
 * screen space.
 *
 * When the user clicks with the left mouse button on the icon, the
 * main application window is shown/raised and activated. With the
 * right mouse button, she gets a popupmenu with application specific
 * commands, including "Minimize/Restore" and "Quit".
 *
 * Docking happens magically when calling show(). The window undocks
 * with either hide() or when it is destroyed.
 *
 * KSystemTray inherits methods such as @ref setPixmap() and @ref setMovie() to
 * specify an icon or movie (animated icon) respectively. It is
 * designed to be usable "as is", without the need to subclass it. In
 * case you need to provide something special (such as an additional
 * popupmenu on a click with the left mouse button), you can subclass
 * anyway, of course.
 *
 * Having an icon on the system tray is a useful technique for
 * daemon-like applications that may run for some time without user
 * interaction but have to be there immediately when the user needs
 * them. Examples are kppp, kisdn, kscd, kmix or knotes. With kppp and
 * kisdn, the docked icon even provides real-time information about
 * the network status.
