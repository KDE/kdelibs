/**
 * Top level widget that provides toolbars, a status line and a frame.
 *
 * It should be used as a top level (parent-less) widget.
 * It manages the geometry for all its children, including your
 * main widget.
 *
 * Normally, you will inherit from KMainWindow,
 * then construct (or use some existing) widget as
 * your main view. You can set only one main view.
 *
 * You can add as many toolbars as you like. There can be only one menubar
 * and only one statusbar.
 *
 * The toolbars, menubar, and statusbar can be created by the
 * KMainWindow and - unlike the old KMainWindow - may, but do not
 * have to, be deleted by you. KMainWindow will handle that internally.
 *
 * Height and width can be operated independently from each other. Simply
 * define the minimum/maximum height/width of your main widget and
 * KMainWindow will take this into account. For fixed size windows set
 * your main widget to a fixed size.
 *
 * Fixed aspect ratios (heightForWidth()) and fixed width widgets are
 * not supported.
*
 * KMainWindow will set icon, mini icon and caption, which it gets
 * from KApplication. It provides full session management, and
 * will save its position, geometry and positions of toolbars and
 * menubar on logout. If you want to save additional data, reimplement
 * saveProperties() and (to read them again on next login)
 * readProperties(). To save special data about your data, reimplement
 * saveGlobalProperties(). To warn user that application or
 * windows have unsaved data on close or logout, reimplement
 * queryClose() and/or queryExit().
 *
 * There are also kRestoreMainWindows convenience functions which
 * can restore all your windows on next login.
 *
 *  Note that a KMainWindow per-default is created with the
 *  WDestructiveClose flag, i.e. it is automatically destroyed when the
 *  window is closed. If you do not want this behavior, specify 0 as
 *  widget flag in the constructor.

     * Construct a main window.
     *
     * @param parent The widget parent. This is usually 0 but it may also be the window
     * group leader. In that case, the KMainWindow becomes sort of a
     * secondary window.
     *
     * @param name The object name. For session management and window management to work
     * properly, all main windows in the application should have a
     * different name. When passing 0 (the default), KMainWindow will create
     * a unique name, but it's recommended to explicitly pass a window name that will
     * also describe the type of the window. If there can be several windows of the same
     * type, append '#' (hash) to the name, and KMainWindow will append numbers to make
     * the names unique. For example, for a mail client which has one main window showing
     * the mails and folders, and which can also have one or more windows for composing
     * mails, the name for the folders window should be e.g. "mainwindow" and
     * for the composer windows "composer#".

     *   int n = 1;
     *   while (KMainWindow::canBeRestored(n)){

     * With this you can easily restore all toplevel windows of your
     * application.
     *
     * If your application uses different kinds of toplevel
     * windows, then you can use KMainWindow::classNameOfToplevel(n)
     * to determine the exact type before calling the childMW
     * constructor in the example from above.
     *
     * If your client has only one kind of toplevel widgets (which
     * should be pretty usual) then you should use the RESTORE-macro
     * for backwards compatibility with 3.1 and 3.0 branches:
     *
     * \code
     * if (kapp->isRestored())
     *   RESTORE(childMW)
     * else {
     *   // create default application as usual
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * The macro expands to the term above but is easier to use and
     * less code to write.
     *
     * For new code or if you have more than one kind of toplevel
     * widget (each derived from KMainWindow, of course), you can
     * use the templated kRestoreMainWindows global functions:
     *
     * \code

     *   kRestoreMainWindows< childMW1, childMW2, childMW3 >();
     * else {

       It is not recommended to do any user interaction in this
       function other than indicating severe errors. Better ask the
       user on queryClose() (see below).

       A typical usage of queryExit() is to write configuration data back.
       Note that the application may continue to run after queryExit()
       (the user may have canceled a shutdown), so you should not do any cleanups
       here. The purpose of queryExit() is purely to prepare the application
       (with possible user interaction) so it can safely be closed later (without
       user interaction).

       If you need to do serious things on exit (like shutting a
       dial-up connection down), connect to the signal
 KApplication::shutDown().

       Default implementation returns @p true. Returning @p false will
       cancel the exiting. In the latter case, the last window will
       remain visible. If KApplication::sessionSaving() is true, refusing
       the exit will also cancel KDE logout.

       Called before the window is closed, either by the user or indirectly by
       the session manager.

       The purpose of this function is to prepare the window in a way that it is
       safe to close it, i.e. without the user losing some data.

       Default implementation returns true. Returning @p false will cancel
       the closing, and, if KApplication::sessionSaving() is true, it will also
       cancel KDE logout.

       Reimplement this function to prevent the user from losing data.
       Example:
       \code
       switch ( KMessageBox::warningYesNoCancel( this,
                i18n("Save changes to document foo?")) ) {

       case KMessageBox::No :
         return true;
       default: // cancel
         return false;
       \endcode

       Note that you should probably @em not actually close the document from
       within this method, as it may be called by the session manager before the
       session is saved. If the document is closed before the session save occurs,
       its location might not be properly saved. In addition, the session shutdown
       may be canceled, in which case the document should remain open.
