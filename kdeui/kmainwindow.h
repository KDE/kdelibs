/**
 * Top level widget that provides toolbars, a status line and a frame.
 *
 * It should be used as a top level (parent-less) widget.
 * It manages the geometry for all its children, including your
 * main widget.
 *
 * Normally, you will inherit from KMainWindow,
 * then construct (or use some existing) widget as
 * your main view. You can set only one main view.
 *
 * You can add as many toolbars as you like. There can be only one menubar
 * and only one statusbar.
 *
 * The toolbars, menubar, and statusbar can be created by the
 * KMainWindow and - unlike the old KMainWindow - may, but do not
 * have to, be deleted by you. KMainWindow will handle that internally.
 *
 * Height and width can be operated independently from each other. Simply
 * define the minimum/maximum height/width of your main widget and
 * KMainWindow will take this into account. For fixed size windows set
 * your main widget to a fixed size.
 *
 * Fixed aspect ratios (heightForWidth()) and fixed width widgets are
 * not supported.
*
 * KMainWindow will set icon, mini icon and caption, which it gets
 * from @ref KApplication. It provides full session management, and
 * will save its position, geometry and positions of toolbars and
 * menubar on logout. If you want to save additional data, reimplement
 * @ref saveProperties() and (to read them again on next login) @ref
 * readProperties(). To save special data about your data, reimplement
 * @ref saveGlobalProperties(). To warn user that application or
 * windows have unsaved data on close or logout, reimplement @ref
 * queryClose() and/or @ref queryExit().
 *
 * There is also a macro RESTORE which can restore all your windows
 * on next login.
 *
 *  Note that a KMainWindow per-default is created with the
 *  WDestructiveClose flag, i.e. it is automatically destroyed when the
 *  window is closed. If you do not want this behavior, specify 0 as
 *  widget flag in the constructor.

     * Construct a main window.

     * @param parent The widget parent. This is usually 0 but it may also be the window
     * group leader. In that case, the KMainWindow becomes sort of a
     * secondary window.
     *
     * @param name The object name. For session management and window management to work
     * properly, all main windows in the application should have a
     * different name. When passing 0 (the default), KMainWindow will create
     * a unique name, but it's recommended to explicitly pass a window name that will
     * also describe the type of the window. If there can be several windows of the same
     * type, append '#' (hash) to the name, and KMainWindow will append numbers to make
     * the names unique. For example, for a mail client which has one main window showing
     * the mails and folders, and which can also have one or more windows for composing
     * mails, the name for the folders window should be e.g. "mainwindow" and
     * for the composer windows "composer#".
