/**
 * Provides a number of ready to use layouts (faces). It is used
 * as an internal widget in @ref KDialogBase, but can also used as a
 * widget of its own.
 *
 * It provides TreeList, IconList, Tabbed, Plain and Swallow layouts.
 *
 * The TreeList face provides a list in the left area and pages in the
 * right. The area are separated by a movable splitter. The style is somewhat
 * similar to the layout in the Control Center. A page is raised by
 * selecting the corresponding tree list item.
 *
 * The IconList face provides an icon list in the left area and pages in the
 * right. For each entry the Icon is on top with the text below. The style
 * is somewhat similar to the layout of the Eudora configuation dialog box.
 * A page is raised by selecting the corresponding icon list item. The
 * preferred icon size is 32x32 pixels.
 *
 * The Tabbed face is a common tabbed widget. The procedure for creating a
 * page is similar for creating a TreeList. This has the advantage that if
 * your widget contain too many pages it is trivial to convert it into a
 * TreeList. Just change the face in the KJanusWidget constructor to
 * KJanusWidget::TreeList and you have a tree list layout instead.
 *
 * The Plain face provides an empty widget (QFrame) where you can place your
 * widgets. The KJanusWidget makes no assumptions regarding the contents so
 * you are free to add whatever you want.
 *
 * The Swallow face is provided in order to simplify the usage of existing
 * widgets and to allow changing the visible widget. You specify the widget
 * to be displayed by @ref #setSwallowedWidget(). Your widget will be
 * reparented inside the widget. You can specify a Null (0) widget. A empty
 * space is then displayed.
 *
 * For all modes it is important that you specify the @ref QWidget::minimumSize()
 * on the page, plain widget or the swallowed widget. If you use a QLayout
 * on the page, plain widget or the swallowed widget this will be taken care
 * of automatically. The size is used when the KJanusWidget determines its
 * own minimum size. You get the minimum size by using the
 * @ref #minimumSizeHint() or @ref #sizeHint() methods.
 *
 * Pages that have been added in TreeList, IconList or Tabbed mode can be
 * removed by simply deleting the page.
 *
 * @short Easy to use widget with many layouts
