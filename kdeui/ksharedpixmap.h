/**
 * Shared pixmap client.
 *
 * A shared pixmap is a pixmap that resides on the X server, is referenced
 * by a global id string, and can be accessed by all X clients.
 *
 * This class is a client class to shared pixmaps in KDE. You can use it
 * to copy (a part of) a shared pixmap into. KSharedPixmap inherits KPixmap
 * for that purpose.
 *
 * The server part of shared pixmaps is not implemented here. 
 * That part is provided by KPixmapServer, in the source file:
 * kdebase/kdesktop/pixmapserver.cc.
 *
 * An example: copy from a shared pixmap:
 * <pre>
 *   KSharedPixmap *pm = new KSharedPixmap;
 *   connect(pm, SIGNAL(done(bool)), SLOT(slotDone(bool)));
 *   pm->loadFromShared("My Pixmap");
 * </pre>
