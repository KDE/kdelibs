/**
 * @short A variant of QListWidget that honors KDE's system-wide settings.
 *
 * Extends the functionality of QListWidget to honor the system
 * wide settings for Single Click/Double Click mode, Auto Selection and
 * Change Cursor over Link.
 *
 * There is a new signal executed(). It gets connected to either
 * QListWidget::itemClicked() or QListWidget::itemDoubleClicked()
 * depending on the KDE wide Single Click/Double Click settings. It is
 * strongly recommended that you use this signal instead of the above
 * mentioned. This way you don't need to care about the current
 * settings.  If you want to get informed when the user selects
 * something connect to the QListWidget::itemSelectionChanged() signal.
