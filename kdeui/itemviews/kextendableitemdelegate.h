/**
  * This delegate makes it possible to display an arbitrary QWidget ("extender") that spans all columns below a line of items.
  * The extender will logically belong to a column in the row above it.
  *
  * It is your responsibility to devise a way to trigger extension and contraction of items, by calling
  * extendItem() and contractItem(). You can e.g. reimplement itemActivated() and similar functions.
  *
  * @warning extendItem() reparents the provided widget @a extender to the
  * viewport of the itemview it belongs to. The @a extender is destroyed when
  * you call contractItem() for the associated index. If you fail to do that
  * and the associated item gets deleted you're in trouble. It remains as a
  * visible artefact in your treeview. Additionally when closing your
  * application you get an assertion failure from KExtendableItemDelegate. Make
  * sure that you always call contractItem for indices before you delete them.
