/**
 * @brief A generic implementation of the "find" function.
 *
 * @author S.R.Haque <srhaque@iee.org>, David Faure <faure@kde.org>,
 *         Arend van Beelen jr. <arend@auton.nl>
 *
 * \b Detail:
 *
 * This class includes prompt handling etc. Also provides some
 * static functions which can be used to create custom behavior
 * instead of using the class directly.
 *
 * \b Example:
 *
 * To use the class to implement a complete find feature:
 *
 * In the slot connected to the find action, after using KFindDialog:
 * \code
 *
 *  // This creates a find-next-prompt dialog if needed.
 *  m_find = new KFind(pattern, options, this);
 *
 *  // Connect highlight signal to code which handles highlighting
 *  // of found text.
 *  connect( m_find, SIGNAL( highlight( const QString &, int, int ) ),
 *          this, SLOT( slotHighlight( const QString &, int, int ) ) );
 *  // Connect findNext signal - called when pressing the button in the dialog
 *  connect( m_find, SIGNAL( findNext() ),
 *          this, SLOT( slotFindNext() ) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you are using a non-modal find dialog (the recommended new way
 * in KDE-3.2), you should call right away m_find->closeFindNextDialog().
 *
 *  Then initialize the variables determining the "current position"
 *  (to the cursor, if the option FromCursor is set,
 *   to the beginning of the selection if the option SelectedText is set,
 *   and to the beginning of the document otherwise).
 *  Initialize the "end of search" variables as well (end of doc or end of selection).
 *  Swap begin and end if FindBackwards.
 *  Finally, call slotFindNext();
 *
 * \code
 *  void slotFindNext()
 *  {
 *      KFind::Result res = KFind::NoMatch;
 *      while ( res == KFind::NoMatch && <position not at end> ) {
 *          if ( m_find->needData() )
 *              m_find->setData( <current text fragment> );
 *
 *          // Let KFind inspect the text fragment, and display a dialog if a match is found
 *          res = m_find->find();
 *
 *          if ( res == KFind::NoMatch ) {
 *              <Move to the next text fragment, honoring the FindBackwards setting for the direction>
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      if ( res == KFind::NoMatch ) // i.e. at end
 *          <Call either  m_find->displayFinalDialog(); m_find->deleteLater(); m_find = 0L;
 *           or           if ( m_find->shouldRestart() ) { reinit (w/o FromCursor) and call slotFindNext(); }
 *                        else { m_find->closeFindNextDialog(); }>
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Don't forget to delete m_find in the destructor of your class,
 *  unless you gave it a parent widget on construction.
 *
 *  This implementation allows to have a "Find Next" action, which resumes the
 *  search, even if the user closed the "Find Next" dialog.
 *
 *  A "Find Previous" action can simply switch temporarily the value of
 *  FindBackwards and call slotFindNext() - and reset the value afterwards.
