- Huge bug: KSimpleConfig doesn't sync up for the certificate cache.  This
  means that stuff randomly disappears from it.  Also I suspect there is a
  small GUI bug still.

- KHTML needs a dialog to warn on an insecure post (unencrypted)
  if the user has selected to do so in kcmcrypto

- The "back" button on konqueror doesn't behave well with kio_https.  Try
  it, you'll see :)

- Provide an option to not load insecure portions of a secured page

- Friend certificates (for S/MIME) are not implemented

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.

- Document libkssl interface

- Make a tamper proof certificate repository of some sort

- Is it possible to provide warning if a particular attack is detected?
  (OpenSSL looks for these if it knows about them)

- Use libkssl in kcmcrypto - libkssl needs lots of work first.
