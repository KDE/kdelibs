This library is severely functionally challenged.

This TODO happens to cover SSL in all of KDE though.

- do the openssl randomization calls for non-linux/bsd systems as per bug
  report #11888

- KSSL needs to be integrated into the slave base in some
  way or another so that kio_pop3 and friends can use it.

- KHTML needs a dialog to warn on an insecure post (unencrypted)
  if the user has selected to do so in kcmcrypto

- KHTML needs a dialog and logic to warn on pages that have some
  frames in SSL and others in non-SSL

- HTTP IOSlave needs to send a message through the UI server to 
  warn on a failed certificate check and prompt for proceed/abort

- The policies for certificates need to be implemented (accept from
  this site even though it is self signed, etc)

- There needs to be a way to warn the user if an SSL page does a redirect
  to a non-SSL page

- The "back" button on konqueror doesn't behave well with kio_https.  Try
  it, you'll see :)

- Provide an option to not load insecure portions of a secured page

- kcmcrypto certificate managing code is not implemented yet

- Personal, other certificates are not implemented

- The certificate cache is not implemented.  This is needed to keep track of
  certificates we have seen this session so we don't prompt the user 300 times
  each time a page loads.

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.

- The certificate home is not done.  It will manage the user's certificates.

- Document libkssl interface

- Make a tamper proof certificate repository of some sort

- Wizard buttons for autoconfiguring the cipher selection

- Is it possible to provide warning if a particular attack is detected?
  (OpenSSL looks for these if it knows about them)

- Use libkssl in kcmcrypto - libkssl needs lots of work first.
