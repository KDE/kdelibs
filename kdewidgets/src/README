KDE Custom Widgets for Qt Designer 2
====================================


Summary:
========

This directory contains KDE custom widgets for Qt Designer which comes with
Qt 4. Just make sure that QT_PLUGIN_PATH includes
$KDEDIR/lib/kde4/plugins . With the KDE build system nothing special 
(i.e. editing the plugin path) is needed, as uic will automatically be
called with -L <path to the kdewidgets plugin> .

This plugin uses the QWidget plugin API of Qt >= 4.0
Don't expect it to work with any other versions of Qt.


Known Bugs:
===========

Designer crashes when using widgets that use the kapp pointer.

HOWTO Add Widgets:
==================
Just add new widgets to kde.widgets like this:
[ClassName]
IncludeFile=myheader.h
IconSet=mycoolwidget.png
ToolTip=My Cool Widget
WhatsThis=Long description of my cool widget
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name, otherNeccessaryArg)
IsContainer=true
Group=MyWidgetCollection

Everything but [ClassName] is optional.
IncludeFile defaults to classname.h (all lowercase)
IconSet defaults to classname.png (all lowercase)
ToolTip defaults to ClassName
WhatsThis defaults to ClassName
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name)
IsContainer defaults to false - note, any value except an empty one is
                                interpreted as true, even if the value
                                is "false" :) So, if the widget is not a
                                container, just omit this line.
Group defaults to "KDE"

Don't forget to add an icon to the pics directory.  Try to make it look similar to the other icons and be the same size.

There are some global options that you can have.

[Global]
Init=new InitCode();
Destroy= delete object;
PluginName=MyPlugin

PluginName overrides the passed in value at the command line and is optional.
Init and Destroy are both optional arguments that can be used for custom build
up and tear down code.

Have fun!
