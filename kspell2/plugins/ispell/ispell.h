 * ISpell plugin.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/08/14 17:51:27  dom
 * update license - exception clause should be Lesser GPL
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/07/28 20:40:26  dom
 * fix up the license clause, further win32-registry proof some directory getting functions
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/07/16 22:52:40  dom
 * LGPL + exception license
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/07/15 01:15:06  dom
 * ispell enchant backend
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/01/24 05:52:33  hippietrail
 *
 * Refactored ispell code. Old ispell global variables had been put into
 * an allocated structure, a pointer to which was passed to many functions.
 * I have now made all such functions and variables private members of the
 * ISpellChecker class. It was C OO, now it's C++ OO.
 *
 * I've fixed the makefiles and tested compilation but am unable to test
 * operation. Please back out my changes if they cause problems which
 * are not obvious or easy to fix.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2002/09/19 05:31:15  hippietrail
 *
 * More Ispell cleanup.  Conditional globals and DEREF macros are removed.
 * K&R function declarations removed, converted to Doxygen style comments
 * where possible.  No code has been changed (I hope).  Compiles for me but
 * unable to test.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2002/09/17 03:03:29  hippietrail
 *
 * After seeking permission on the developer list I've reformatted all the
 * spelling source which seemed to have parts which used 2, 3, 4, and 8
 * spaces for tabs.  It should all look good with our standard 4-space
 * tabs now.
 * I've concentrated just on indentation in the actual code.  More prettying
 * could be done.
 * * NO code changes were made *
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/03/22 14:31:57  dom
 * fix mg's compile problem
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2002/03/05 16:55:52  dom
 * compound word support, tested against swedish
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/08/10 18:32:40  dom
 * Spelling and iconv updates. god, i hate iconv
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/06/26 16:33:27  dom
 * 128 StringChars and some other stuff
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/05/12 16:05:42  thomasf
 * Big pseudo changes to ispell to make it pass around a structure rather
 * than rely on all sorts of gloabals willy nilly here and there.  Also
 * fixed our spelling class to work with accepting suggestions once more.
 * This code is dirty, gross and ugly (not to mention still not supporting
 * multiple hash sized just yet) but it works on my machine and will no
 * doubt break other machines.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/04/18 00:59:36  thomasf
 * Removed the duplicate declarations of variables that was causing build
 * to bail.  This new ispell stuff is a total mess.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/04/15 16:01:24  tomas_f
 * moving to spell/xp
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/04/13 12:33:12  tamlin
 * ispell can now be used from C++
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/03/25 01:30:02  tomb
 * 1. Fixed ispell #define problems on Win32
 * 2. Changed the way that togglable toolbars are tracked so that Full
 * Screen mode works right on Windows
 * 3. Fixed SET_GATHER macro in ap_Win32Dialog_Options.h
 * 4. Fixed Toggle Case dialog to default to Sentence Case when loaded
 * 5. Added #define for Auto Save checkbox (though I haven't updated the
 * Prefs dialog yet)
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2001/03/24 23:28:41  dom
 * Make C++ aware and watch out for VOID on Win32
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1999/12/21 18:46:29  sterwill
 * ispell patch for non-English dictionaries by Henrik Berg <henrik@lansen.se>
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1999/10/20 03:19:35  paul
 * Hacked ispell code to ignore any characters that don't fit in the lookup tables loaded from the dictionary.  It ain't pretty, but at least we don't crash there any more.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1999/09/29 23:33:32  justin
 * Updates to the underlying ispell-based code to support suggested corrections.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1999/04/13 17:12:51  jeff
 * Applied "Darren O. Benham" <gecko@benham.net> spell check changes.
 * Fixed crash on Win32 with the new code.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1999/01/07 05:14:22  sterwill
 * So it builds on Unix... it might break win32 in ispell, since ut_types
 * is no longer included.  This is a temporary solution to a larger problem
 * of including C++ headers in C source files.

 * So it builds on Unix... it might break win32 in ispell, since ut_types

 *
 * Revision 1.5  1999/01/07 05:02:25  sterwill
 * Checking in half-broken to avoid tree lossage
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1999/01/07 01:07:48  paul
 * Fixed spell leaks.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1998/12/29 15:03:54  eric
 *
 * minor fix to ispell.h to get things to compile on Linux again.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1998/12/29 14:55:33  eric
 *
 * I've doctored the ispell code pretty extensively here.  It is now
 * warning-free on Win32.  It also *works* on Win32 now, since I
 * replaced all the I/O calls with ANSI standard ones.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1998/12/28 18:04:43  davet
 * Spell checker code stripped from ispell.  At this point, there are
 * two external routines...  the Init routine, and a check-a-word routine
 * which returns a boolean value, and takes a 16 bit char string.
 * The code resembles the ispell code as much as possible still.
 *
 * Revision 1.68  1995/03/06  02:42:41  geoff
 * Be vastly more paranoid about parenthesizing macro arguments.  This
 * fixes a bug in defmt.c where a complex argument was passed to
 * isstringch.
 *
 * Revision 1.67  1995/01/03  19:24:12  geoff
 * Get rid of a non-global declaration.
 *
 * Revision 1.66  1994/12/27  23:08:49  geoff
 * Fix a lot of subtly bad assumptions about the widths of ints and longs
 * which only show up on 64-bit machines like the Cray and the DEC Alpha.
 *
 * Revision 1.65  1994/11/02  06:56:10  geoff
 * Remove the anyword feature, which I've decided is a bad idea.
 *
 * Revision 1.64  1994/10/25  05:46:18  geoff
 * Add the FF_ANYWORD flag for defining an affix that will apply to any
 * word, even if not explicitly specified.  (Good for French.)
 *
 * Revision 1.63  1994/09/16  04:48:28  geoff
 * Make stringdups and laststringch unsigned ints, and dupnos a plain
 * int, so that we can handle more than 128 stringchars and stringchar
 * types.
 *
 * Revision 1.62  1994/09/01  06:06:39  geoff
 * Change erasechar/killchar to uerasechar/ukillchar to avoid
 * shared-library problems on HP systems.
 *
 * Revision 1.61  1994/08/31  05:58:35  geoff
 * Add contextoffset, used in -a mode to handle extremely long lines.
 *
 * Revision 1.60  1994/05/17  06:44:15  geoff
 * Add support for controlled compound formation and the COMPOUNDONLY
 * option to affix flags.
 *
 * Revision 1.59  1994/03/15  06:25:16  geoff
 * Change deftflag's initialization so we can tell if -t/-n appeared.
 *
 * Revision 1.58  1994/02/07  05:53:28  geoff
 * Add typecasts to the the 7-bit versions of ichar* routines
 *
 * Revision 1.57  1994/01/25  07:11:48  geoff
 * Get rid of all old RCS log lines in preparation for the 3.1 release.

**
** If a word has only one capitalization form, and that form is not
** FOLLOWCASE, it will have exactly one entry in the dictionary.  The
** legal capitalizations will be indicated by the 2-bit capitalization
** field, as follows:
**
**	ALLCAPS		The word must appear in all capitals.
**	CAPITALIZED	The word must be capitalized (e.g., London).
**			It will also be accepted in all capitals.
**	ANYCASE		The word may appear in lowercase, capitalized,
**			or all-capitals.
**
** Regardless of the capitalization flags, the "word" field of the entry
** will point to an all-uppercase copy of the word.  This is to simplify
** the large portion of the code that doesn't care about capitalization.
** Ispell will generate the correct version when needed.
**
** If a word has more than one capitalization, there will be multiple
** entries for it, linked together by the "next" field.  The initial
** entry for such words will be a dummy entry, primarily for use by code
** that ignores capitalization.  The "word" field of this entry will
** again point to an all-uppercase copy of the word.  The "mask" field
** will contain the logical OR of the mask fields of all variants.
** A header entry is indicated by a capitalization type of ALLCAPS,
** with the MOREVARIANTS bit set.
**
** The following entries will define the individual variants.  Each
** entry except the last has the MOREVARIANTS flag set, and each
** contains one of the following capitalization options:
**
**	ALLCAPS		The word must appear in all capitals.
**	CAPITALIZED	The word must be capitalized (e.g., London).
**			It will also be accepted in all capitals.
**	FOLLOWCASE	The word must be capitalized exactly like the
**			sample in the entry.  Prefix (suffix) characters
**			must be rendered in the case of the first (last)
**			"alphabetic" character.  It will also be accepted
**			in all capitals.  ("Alphabetic" means "mentioned
**			in a 'casechars' statement".)
**	ANYCASE		The word may appear in lowercase, capitalized,
**			or all-capitals.
**
** The "mask" field for the entry contains only the affix flag bits that
** are legal for that capitalization.  The "word" field will be null
** except for FOLLOWCASE entries, where it will point to the
** correctly-capitalized spelling of the root word.
**
** It is worth discussing why the ALLCAPS option is used in
** the header entry.  The header entry accepts an all-capitals
** version of the root plus every affix (this is always legal, since
** words get capitalized in headers and so forth).  Further, all of
** the following variant entries will reject any all-capitals form
** that is illegal due to an affix.
**
** Finally, note that variations in the KEEP flag can cause a multiple-variant
** entry as well.  For example, if the personal dictionary contains "ALPHA",
** (KEEP flag set) and the user adds "alpha" with the KEEP flag clear, a
** multiple-variant entry will be created so that "alpha" will be accepted
** but only "ALPHA" will actually be kept.
