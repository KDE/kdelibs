         * \brief A FacetModel contains a list of facets that are provided in a tree structure.
         *
         * The FacetModel manages a list of Facet instances that are layed out
         * in a tree structure in which the leafs are checkable. This allows to
         * easily configure the facets by clicking the tree.
         *
         * Facets are added via setFacets() and addFacet().
         *
         * The FacetModel can be used to create and augment queries using the queryTerm()
         * method and connecting to the queryTermChanged() signal. In addition %FacetModel
         * provides the extractFacetsFromTerm() method which \em converts a query into
         * facet selections. This is very convinient if the query comes from another source
         * like a query bookmark or another application.
         *
         * An improved user experience can be created by setting the final query used to
         * list the results via setClientQuery(). This allows the %FacetModel to filter
         * the available choices, hiding those that do not make sense with the current
         * result set or even showing facets that did not make sense before (compare the
         * ProxyFacet example in \ref nepomuk_facet_examples).
         *
         * Typically one would use FacetWidget instead of creating ones own FacetModel.
