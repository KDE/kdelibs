         * \brief The base class for all facets used to create query filters.
         *
         * A Facet represents one aspect of a query like the resource type or
         * the modification date. By providing a list of facets to the user they
         * can interactively construct a query by restricting the result set step
         * by step.
         *
         * A Facet can be seen as a list of choices presented to the user. Depending
         * on the selection (which is typically triggered by user interaction) the
         * Facet produces a resulting term() which is then used in the final query.
         *
         * Each facet needs to implement a set of methods describing the choices:
         * count(), guiItem(), isSelected(), setSelected(), and clearSelection().
         * In addition the term() method constructs the term this facet represents
         * with its current selection.
         *
         * Methods selectFromTerm() and setClientQuery() are optional but allow for a
         * more advanced usage and a better user experience. See the method documentation
         * for details.
         *
         * Before implementing your own Facet subclass make sure that SimpleFacet or
         * DynamicResourceFacet do not suit your needs.
         *
         * Facet also provides a set of static factory methods like createTagFacet() or
         * createFileTypeFacet() to create standard facets that are useful in most
         * query UI situations.
