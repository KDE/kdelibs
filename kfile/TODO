TODO-List for the KFileDialog and associated classes (in order of importance)

- are more messageboxes necessary?
- KFD's default dirs configurable
- roation is quite broken ;( Most probably KComboBox, and I guess KLineEdit
- drag&drop support for the views (somehow into baseclass KFileView?
- fix multiselection (parsing of the selected files in the locationCombo)
- KFileView::setCurrentItem() / highlight() ?!?!
- KFileView::setSelected( const QRegExp& )
- what about KRemoteFile?
- separate KDirOperator, location-combo, filter-combo etc. from KFileDialog
  to another widget (everything besides OK/Cancel buttons).
- implement in-place editing (rename) + make it configurable in all views
- make a simple fileview based on QListBox
- implement KFile::PreviewInfo
- signal KFileView::selectionCleared()

- Allow filtering on MimeType (instead of extension).

If anyone wants to implement some of those, please do. In case of questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.
