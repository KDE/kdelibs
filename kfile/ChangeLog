Tue Apr 20 18:10:58 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfilesimpleview.cpp (insertItem): QList::insert() seems to have
	changed: valid range for index is only from 0 to count(). Passing -1
	as index results in an error - and a segfault in kfile.
	=> changed KFileSimpleView::insertItem() to set index to count() if
	it is set to -1 (coming from KFileInfoContents::setSorting()).

	of encoded one

	And the currently selected item is rehighlighted correctly after
	resizing, now.
