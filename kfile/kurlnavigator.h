/**
 * @brief Allows to navigate through the paths of an URL.
 *
 * The URL navigator offers two modes:
 * - Editable:     Represents the 'classic' mode, where the URL
 *                 is editable inside a line editor. By pressing RETURN
 *                 the URL will get activated.
 * - Non editable ("breadcrumb view"): The URL is represented by a
 *                 number of buttons, where each button represents a path
 *                 of the URL. By clicking on a button the path will get
 *                 activated. This mode also supports drag and drop of items.
 *
 * The mode can be changed by clicking on the empty area of the URL navigator.
 * It is recommended that the application remembers the setting
 * of the mode or allows the user to configure the default mode
 * (see KUrlNavigator::setUrlEditable()).
 *
 * The URL navigator remembers the URL history during navigation and allows to go
 * back and forward within this history.
 *
 * The typical usage of the KUrlNavigator is:
 * - Create an instance providing a places model and an URL.
 * - Create an instance of QAbstractItemView which shows the content of the URL
 *   given by the URL navigator.
 * - Connect to the signal KUrlNavigator::urlChanged() and synchronize the content of
 *   QAbstractItemView with the URL given by the URL navigator.
