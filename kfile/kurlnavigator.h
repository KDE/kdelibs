/**
 * @brief Widget that allows to navigate through the paths of an URL.
 *
 * The URL navigator offers two modes:
 * - Editable:     The URL of the location is editable inside an editor.
 *                 By pressing RETURN the URL will get activated.
 * - Non editable ("breadcrumb view"): The URL of the location is represented by
 *                 a number of buttons, where each button represents a path
 *                 of the URL. By clicking on a button the path will get
 *                 activated. This mode also supports drag and drop of items.
 *
 * The mode can be changed by clicking on the empty area of the URL navigator.
 * It is recommended that the application remembers the setting
 * or allows to configure the default mode (see KUrlNavigator::setUrlEditable()).
 *
 * The URL navigator remembers the URL history during navigation and allows to go
 * back and forward within this history.
 *
 * In the non editable mode ("breadcrumb view") it can be configured whether
 * the full path should be shown. It is recommended that the application
 * remembers the setting or allows to configure the default mode (see
 * KUrlNavigator::setShowFullPath()).
 *
 * The typical usage of the KUrlNavigator is:
 * - Create an instance providing a places model and an URL.
 * - Create an instance of QAbstractItemView which shows the content of the URL
 *   given by the URL navigator.
 * - Connect to the signal KUrlNavigator::urlChanged() and synchronize the content of
 *   QAbstractItemView with the URL given by the URL navigator.
 *
 * It is recommended, that the application remembers the state of the QAbstractItemView
 * when the URL has been changed. This allows to restore the view state when going back in history.
 * KUrlNavigator offers support for remembering the view state:
 * - The signal urlAboutToBeChanged() will be emitted before the URL change takes places.
 *   This allows the application to store the view state by KUrlNavigator::saveLocationState().
 * - The signal urlChanged() will be emitted after the URL change took place. This allows
 *   the application to restore the view state by getting the values from
 *   KUrlNavigator::locationState().
