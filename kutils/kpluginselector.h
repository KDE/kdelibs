/**
 * @short A widget to select what plugins to load and configure the plugins.
 *
 * It shows the list of available plugins on top (if there's more than one
 * category this is a TabWidget) and the configuration of the selected plugin
 * below that.
 *
 * Since the user needs a way to know what a specific plugin does every plugin
 * sould install a desktop file containing a name, comment and category field.
 * The category is usefull for applications that can use different kinds of
 * plugins like a playlist, skin or visualization.
 *
 * The location of these desktop files is the
 * share/apps/&lt;instancename&gt;/&lt;plugindir&gt; directory. But if you need
 * you may use a different directory.
 *
 * Often a program has more than one kind of plugin. In that case you want to
 * make a visible distinction between those plugins. All you have to do is to
 * create a KPluginSelectionWidget for every category and then add them all
 * to the KPluginSelector.
