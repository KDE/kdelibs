Hello.  kdelibs/kformula (different from koffice/kformula) is
a widget for entering formulas.  It can also be used to evaluate
formulas with variables which makes writing something like an
equation grapher pretty easy.  See KFormula::evaluate(...) in
kformula.h for more info.  Here's a list of keys it uses:

CTRL+/		fraction
CTRL+6		power
CTRL+-		subscript
CTRL+SHIFT+6	left superscript
CTRL+SHIFT+-	left subscript
(		parentheses (select something and then hit '('
		to enclose it in parentheses)
|		absolute value (same as with parentheses)
CTRL+2		root
CTRL+3		matrix (dialog pops up)
CTRL+4		integral
CTRL+5		sum
CTRL+8		product
CTRL+[		above
CTRL+]		below
CTRL+>		arrow (more symbols RSN)

Look at KFormulaEdit::keyPressEvent(...) and box.h for all the keys.
Although this still lacks several features (most notably, symbols, fonts,
and colors, as well as a toolbar), it is already usable so please use it
and send me bug reports!
