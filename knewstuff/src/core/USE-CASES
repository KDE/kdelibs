KHotNewStuff2  Application use-cases:

Wallpaper 

Wallpapers are installed to a shared location (share/wallpapers) and many 
interfaces might want to invoke KNS Download Dialog to get them (desktop containment config
window, maybe kdm, other containment config windows, maybe the frame widget config dialog.


Vocabulary

Vocabulary files can be shared by a few applications, those that want to share install
their files to share/apps/kvtml/ optionally in a locale sub-folder.  Each app currently
has it's own provider and it's own data files, but they can all use each others files.


Color Schemes

ColorSchemes are installed to a common place, and are only invoked from the colors kcm module.


Game apps

Game apps probably will want to have different categories in it's knsrc file so it can use one
knsrc file (and one download dialog) to download themes and levels (maybe?).



KHotNewStuff2  End-user use-cases:

Extendability:

Fred, Sysadmin for school X is asked by language teachers to set up a KNS provider for them to
upload vocabulary files to on their website, and have it be accessible by registered students from
home.



System installs:

Fred is then asked to install all the teacher's uploaded vocab files onto each machine at the lab
at school for students to have them accessible, each student has their own home folder, but Fred
doesn't want to install to each person's folder, so uses the "Install to share" option, and they
are installed to system folder, since his user has rights to write there.
