- Stop loading of image previews that are not visible / only load visible previews (and maybe a couple that will come up next)
- Indicator when fetching the next page of items (when scrolling down)
- Scrolling with mousewheel jumps over multiple items
- Details dialog: buttons don't get updated
- support gui switching scope (user to system, and back)
- support multiple provider urls with ui to add/remove/edit

- make an app that shows all the available knsrc files, and launches download/upload dialog on selected one
