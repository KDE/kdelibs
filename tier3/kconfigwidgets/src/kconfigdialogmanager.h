/**
 * @short Provides a means of automatically retrieving,
 * saving and resetting KConfigSkeleton based settings in a dialog.
 *
 * The KConfigDialogManager class provides a means of automatically
 * retrieving, saving and resetting basic settings.
 * It also can emit signals when settings have been changed
 * (settings were saved) or modified (the user changes a checkbox
 * from on to off).
 *
 * The names of the widgets to be managed have to correspond to the names of the
 * configuration entries in the KConfigSkeleton object plus an additional
 * "kcfg_" prefix. For example a widget named "kcfg_MyOption" would be
 * associated to the configuration entry "MyOption".
 *
 * New widgets can be added to the map using the static functions propertyMap() and
 * changedMap().  Note that you can't just add any class.  The class must have a 
 * matching Q_PROPERTY(...) macro defined, and a signal which emitted when the
 * property changed. Note: by default, the property which defined as "USER true" 
 * is used.
 *
 * For example (note that KColorButton is already added and it doesn't need to
 * manually added):
 *
 * kcolorbutton.h defines the following property:
 * \code
 * Q_PROPERTY( QColor color READ color WRITE setColor USER true )
 * \endcode
 * and signal:
 * \code
 * void changed( const QColor &newColor );
 * \endcode
 *
 * To add KColorButton the following code would be inserted in the main:
 *
 * \code
 * KConfigDialogManager::changedMap()->insert("KColorButton", SIGNAL(changed(const QColor &)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you want to use a widget's property that is not the USER property,
 * you can define which property to use in the widget's kcfg_property:
 * \code
 * KUrlRequester *myWidget = new KUrlRequester;
 * myWidget->setProperty("kcfg_property", QByteArray("text"));
 * \endcode
 *
 * Alternatively you can set the kcfg_property using designer.
