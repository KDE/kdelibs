KNewStuff2 test applications
============================

If you want the test apps, set -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=ON for cmake.

In order to understand the test structure, remember the engine class
hierarchy of the library:
 KNS::CoreEngine    - GHNS provider loading/upload/download
 -> KNS::DxsEngine  - DXS interaction (contains KNS::Dxs child)
   -> KNS::Engine   - dialog integration and convenience wrappers

knewstuff2_test:
 * test CoreEngine functionality
 * command line only
 * syntax 1: knewstuff2_test (downloads feed and caches)
 * syntax 2: knewstuff2_test --testall (also downloads files)

knewstuff2_download:
 * test CoreEngine functionality
 * custom download dialog

knewstuff2_cache:
 * test CoreEngine functionality
 * reports contents of cache

knewstuff2_standard:
 * test Engine functionality
 * uses standard dialogs
 * syntax 1: knewstuff2_standard --download
 * syntax 2: knewstuff2_standard --upload <payloadfile>

kdxspreview:
 * test Dxs functionality
 * dialog partially reused from knewstuff2/ui (still unclean)
