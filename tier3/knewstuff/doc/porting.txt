KNewStuff2 Porting Information
==============================

«Where did all the classes go?»

data/
 (GHNS format schemas and example data)
 -> see http://ghns.freedesktop.org/spec/ now

downloaddialog.*
uploaddialog.*
providerdialog.*
 (graphical dialogs)
 -> upload/providerdialog still used, in knewstuff2/ui/
 -> the download dialog is the one from okular
 -> the old knewstuff1 download dialog is gone

ghns.*
testnewstuff.*
 (test applications)
 -> see tests/ for some new tests (has its own README.tests)

entry.*
provider.*
 (entities/data handling classes)
 -> see knewstuff2/core/
 -> author, feed and category are now additional entities

security.*
 -> see knewstuff2/core/

knewstuffbutton.*
 -> TODO
 -> will go to knewstuff2/ui/ (there's already kdxsbutton)

engine.*
 (non-graphical upload/download functionality)
 -> there are 3 engine classes now
 -> the one in knewstuff2/core/coreengine.* is similar
 -> but it also handles installation and caching
 -> the one in knewstuff2/dxs/dxsengine.* implements DXS
 -> the one in knewstuff2/engine.* is for applications (use only this one!)

knewstuff.*
knewstuffgeneric.*
knewstuffsecure.*
  -> doesn't exist anymore
  -> inherited from it? bad luck, was discouraged by tutorial
  -> all custom installation etc. is now handled by *.knsrc files
