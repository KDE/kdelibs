This file lists known packaging formats/drafts so we know if
we need to do anything about it (e.g. provide convenience APIs
for some packages).

Plasma: http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma/Package

GGZ level packs: /playground/gamedata/README.gamedata in GGZ SVN

... (TODO: find out structure of KNewStuff1 packages)

I considered also:
* Artworks
* Kross
* QtScript
* Custom (standard KGHNS2 package, supported additions app-specific)
