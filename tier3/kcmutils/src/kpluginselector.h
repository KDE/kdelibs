/**
  * @short A widget to select what plugins to load and configure the plugins.
  *
  * It shows the list of available plugins
  *
  * Since the user needs a way to know what a specific plugin does every plugin
  * sould install a desktop file containing a name, comment and category field.
  * The category is useful for applications that can use different kinds of
  * plugins like a playlist, skin or visualization
  *
  * The location of these desktop files is the
  * share/apps/&lt;instancename&gt;/&lt;plugindir&gt; directory. But if you need
  * you may use a different directory
  *
  * You can add plugins from different KConfig[group], by just calling all times
  * you want addPlugins method with the correct parameters
  *
  * Additionally, calls to constructor with same @p categoryName, will add new
  * items to the same category, even if plugins are from different categories
