Known Issues [PENDING]:
=======================
* [QtWebKit] Form completion like the one available in native Qt widgets such
  as QLineEdit is missing due to lack of access to form elements.
  See http://webkit.org/b/36668.

Known Issues [PARTIALLY FIXED]:
===============================
* [QtWebKit] Spell checking support. See https://webkit.org/b/44114 [ QtWebKit > 2.2 ]
  Some support was implemented but did not quite make it into QtWebKit 2.2.
  It will probably be in future releases. However, what is implemented in QtWebKit is
  the continuous spell check or spell-check-as-you-type functionality. The ability to
  passively spell check (by selecting option from a context menu) is something that
  can be implemented in the specific browser implementation. kwebkitpart already
  provides such support.

Known Issues [FIXED]:
=====================
* [kdewebkit] Proper support for putting ioslaves on hold. [KDE 4.6]
  Handling unsupported content always requires more than one connection to the
  same server to download a single request. The upstream change requested,
  http://webkit.org/b/37880, turned out to be the wrong solution. The issue has
  now been correctly addressed within KDE itself. You can find the details of
  the fix at http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6182/ & http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6183/

* [QtWebKit] Missing Java applet support. [QtWebKit 2.1*]
  See http://webkit.org/b/33044.

* [QtWebKit] Crash while browsing facebook. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  Specifically when it contains the keyword "attachment" the content returned
  is not supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See http://webkit.org/b/36395.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop <meta> tag based page refresh. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/29899

* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not properly work for most users depending 
  on how their distro created their Qt library package. [QtWebKit >= 2.2]

  With QtWebKit 2.2, HTML 5 <video> support is internally handled by QtWebKit using
  WebKit's gstreamer integration. For the details on how and why that was done see
  https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-qt/2011-June/001633.html.


NOTES:
======
** Qt 4.7.x comes with QtWebkit 2.0.x
