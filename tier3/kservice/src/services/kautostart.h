/**
 * KAutostart provides a programmatic means to control the state of
 * autostart services on a per-user basis. This is useful for applications
 * that wish to offer a configurable means to allow the application to be
 * autostarted.
 *
 * By using this class you future-proof your applications against potential
 * future or platform-specific changes to the autostart mechanism(s).
 *
 * Typical usage might look like:
 *
 * @code
 * KAutostart autostart; // without an entryName arg, gets name from KAboutData
 * autostart.setAutostarts(true); // will now start up when the user logs in
 *
 * // set the value in our configuration settings to reflect whether or not
 * // we will actually start up on log in
 * config.setAutoStart(autostart.autoStarts());
 * @endcode
