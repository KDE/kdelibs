[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-Args]
Type=QString

# If false, this component won't be used when clicking on a file,
# the user will have to use "Embed in..." to use it (or the application
# will have to explicitely embed this particular service, like for the sidebar)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-AllowAsDefault]
Type=bool

# If true, this component won't appear in the "Embed in..." popupmenu
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-HideFromMenus]
Type=bool

# If true, the view will have its "linked" checkbox checked in Konqueror
# (Was initially for the sidebar, but it's a FollowActive nowadays)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-LinkedView]
Type=bool

# If true, this view shows a hierarchical view, i.e. more than one dir at a time
# This is used by KonqPopupMenu to know whether to offer "Create Directory"
# in the RMB menu on a directory (since it depends on whether the user would
# see that new dir).
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-HierarchicalView]
Type=bool

# If true, the view is passive (can't be made the current active view)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-PassiveMode]
Type=bool

# If true, the view can only be there 0 or 1 time in a given window,
# and a toggle action for it will be created (examples: sidebar, konsolepart)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-Toggable]
Type=bool

# If the view is toggable, this defines its orientation (Horizontal or Vertical)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-ToggableView-Orientation]
Type=QString

# The name of the property in the view, which the application should set
# in order to quickly switch the view mode (only meaningful in views that
# support multiple modes in the same widget, like the iconview)
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-ModeProperty]
Type=QString

# The value to set for the above property

Type=QString

# If true, this view will always "follow the active view" (and vice versa:
# when the active view goes to another url, this view will follow).
# Mostly used by the sidebar.
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-FollowActive]
Type=bool

# If this property is set, this view is "builtin" to the application using it
# The value of the property is the application in question (e.g. "konqueror").
# This is used 1) to set the active instance to the app's (so the bugs
# go to "konqueror" and not to "konqiconview") and 2) to let konq remember
# that this view was used last. We don't want special-purpose views
# (like Cervisia) to be reactivated (possibly on another directory) next time
# (famous bug).
[PropertyDef::X-KDE-BrowserView-Built-Into]
Type=QString

# If the part has a plugin for KHTML Javascript's window.navigator.plugins
# array, it should create a plugin info file and set this propery to the
# file path here. The path should be relative to KDE's data dir
# ($KDEDIR/share/apps)
