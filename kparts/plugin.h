 * A plugin is the way to add actions to an existing KParts application,

 *
 * The XML of those plugins looks exactly like of the shell or parts,
 * with one small difference: The document tag should have an additional
 * attribute, named "library", and contain the name of the library implementing
 * the plugin.
 *
 * If you want this plugin to be used by a part, you need to
 * install the rc file under the directory
 * "data" (KDEDIR/share/apps usually)+"/instancename/kpartplugins/"
 * where instancename is the name of the part's instance.
 *
 * You should also install a "plugin info" .desktop file with the same name.
 * \see KPluginInfo

     * the old plugins are not loaded. Increase both numbers every time a
