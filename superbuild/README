== Superbuild ==

Superbuild can be used to build all frameworks in tier1/ and tier2/ standalone
and/or one-by-one. This is useful to check whether they actually build and
install standalone cleanly.

If the library depends on other libraries of kdelibs, i.e. it is a tier2/ or
tier3/ library, it will try to use them from the superbuild. If the respective
library has not been enabled in the superbuild, it will try to use the one
installed on the system.

# Building standalone frameworks

To build framework 'foo' standalone, run `make sb_foo`.

Note that running `make sb_foo` will actually build *and install* the
framework.

Alternatively, you can go to the `superbuild/name_of_framework` subdir of the
build dir and run `make` and `make install` from there.

To build all frameworks standalone, run `make sb_all`.

# Adding new frameworks

Edit `superbuild/CMakeLists.txt`, add a call to sb_add_project(). Follow the
examples of other frameworks.
