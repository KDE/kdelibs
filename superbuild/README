== Superbuild ==

Superbuild can be used to build all libraries in tier1/ and tier2/ standalone
and/or one-by-one. This is useful to check whether they actually
build and install standalone cleanly.

To use it, run cmake pointing to kdelibs/superbuild/ as top level directory.
Installation happens already during the build phase, this is different from
normal builds.
After running initially, no libraries are enabled.
To do so, run cmake-gui, and check those libraries you want to build, e.g. "BUILD_karchive".

For each enabled library, a subdirectory for building will be created.
You can also change into that directory and build there like in a normal build dir
(it actually is a normal build dir).
When disabling a library, its builddir will be removed.

If the library depends on other libraries of kdelibs, i.e. it is a tier2/ or tier3/ library,
it will try to use them from the superbuild. If the respective library has not been
enabled in the superbuild, it will try to use the one installed on the system.
