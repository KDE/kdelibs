== Superbuild ==

Superbuild can be used to build all frameworks standalone.  This is useful to
check whether they actually build and install standalone cleanly.

# Building standalone frameworks

To build framework 'foo' standalone, run `make sb_foo`: this will build *and
install* the framework.

Note that this will also build *all* the frameworks listed before `foo` in
CMakeLists.txt.

Alternatively, you can go to the `superbuild/name_of_framework` subdir of the
build dir and run `make` and `make install` from there. This won't trigger the
build of frameworks listed before.

To build all frameworks standalone, run `make sb_all`.

# Adding new frameworks

Edit `superbuild/CMakeLists.txt`, add a call to sb_add_project(). Make sure a
framework is listed *after* all its dependencies.
