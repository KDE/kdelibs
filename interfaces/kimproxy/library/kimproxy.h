/**
 * This class provides an easy-to-use interface to any instant messengers or chat programs
 * that you have installed that implement KIMIface
 *
 * It works simultaneously with any running programs that implement the ServiceType DBUS/InstantMessenger
 * If a UID is reachable with more than one program, KIMProxy aggregates the available information and presents
 * the 'best' presence.  For example, for a contact who can be seen to be Away in IRC on program A but Online using
 * ICQ on program B, the information from program B will be used.  KIMProxy is designed for simple information in
 * a wide number of cases, not for detailed messaging.
 *
 * Most operations work in terms of uids belonging to KABC::Addressee, but use of the
 * address book is optional.  You can get a list of known contacts with imAddresseeUids
 * and then check their presence using the various accessor methods presenceString, presenceNumeric
 * and display the IM programs' display names for them using displayName.
 *
 * To use, just get an instance using @ref instance.
