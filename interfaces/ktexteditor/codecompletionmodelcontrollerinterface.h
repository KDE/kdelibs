 *
 * \ingroup kte_group_ccmodel_extensions
 *
 * The CodeCompletionModelControllerInterface gives an CodeCompletionModel better
 * control over the completion.
 *
 * By implementing methods defined in this interface you can:
 * - control when automatic completion should start (shouldStartCompletion())
 * - define a custom completion range (that will be replaced when the completion 
 *   is executed) (completionRange())
 * - dynamically modify the completion range during completion (updateCompletionRange())
 * - specify the string used for filtering the completion (filterString())
 * - control when completion should stop (shouldAbortCompletion())
 *
 * When the interface is not implemented, or no methods are overridden the
 * default behaviour is used, which will be correct in many situations.
 * 
 *
 * \section markext_access Implemeting the Interface
 * To use this class implement it in your CodeCompletionModel.
