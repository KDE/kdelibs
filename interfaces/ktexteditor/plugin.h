/**
 * \brief KTextEditor Plugin interface.
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - \ref plugin_intro
 *  - \ref plugin_config
 *  - \ref plugin_sessions
 *  - \ref plugin_arch
 *
 * \section plugin_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Plugin class provides methods to create loadable plugins for all
 * KTextEditor implementations. A plugin can handle several documents and
 * views. For every document the plugin should handle addDocument() is called
 * and for every view addView().
 *
 * \section plugin_config Configuration Management
 *
 * @todo write docu about config pages (new with kpluginmanager)
 * @todo write docu about save/load settings (related to config page)
 *
 * \section plugin_sessions Session Management
 *
 * As an extension a Plugin can implement the SessionConfigInterface. This
 * interface provides functions to read and write session related settings.
 * If you have session dependent data additionally derive your Plugin from
 * this interface and implement the session related functions, for example:
 * \code
 * class MyPlugin : public KTextEditor::Plugin,
 *                  public KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface
 * {
 *   Q_OBJECT
 *   Q_INTERFACES(KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface)
 *
 *   // ...
 *   virtual void readSessionConfig (const KConfigGroup& config);
 *   virtual void writeSessionConfig (KConfigGroup& config);
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section plugin_arch Plugin Architecture
 *
 * After the plugin is loaded the editor implementation should call
 * addDocument() and addView() for all documents and views the plugin should
 * handle. If your plugin has a GUI it is common to add an extra class, like:
 * \code
 * class PluginView : public QObject, public KXMLGUIClient
 * {
 *     Q_OBJECT
 * public:
 *     // Constructor and other methods
 *     PluginView( KTextEditor::View* view )
 *       : QObject( view ), KXMLGUIClient( view ), m_view( view )
 *     { ... }
 *     // ...
 * private:
 *     KTextEditor::View* m_view;
 * };
 * \endcode
 * Your KTextEditor::Plugin derived class then will create a new PluginView
 * for every View, i.e. for every call of addView().
 *
 * The method removeView() will be called whenever a View is removed/closed.
 * If you have a PluginView for every view this is the place to remove it.
 *
 * \see KTextEditor::Editor, KTextEditor::Document, KTextEditor::View,
 *      KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface
