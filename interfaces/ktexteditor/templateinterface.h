     * \return true if inserting the string succeeded
     *
     * Use insertTemplateText(lines(), ...) to append text at end of document
     * Template  strings look like
     * "for( int ${index}=0;${index}<10;${index}++) { ${cursor} };"
     * or "%{date}"
     *
     * This syntax is somewhat similar to the one found in the Eclipse editor or textmate.
     *
     * There are certain common placeholders (macros), which get assigned a
     * default initialValue, If the second parameter does not a given value.
     * For all others the initial value is the name of the placeholder.
     *
     * Placeholder names may only consist of a-zA-Z0-9_
     * 
     * @since 4.5
     * if a placeholder is a mirror, the place holder name may contain additional information
     * ${something/regexp/replacement/} takes the value of the placeholder something and replaces the match with the replacement before inserting the mirrored value
     * ${something/regexp/replacement/g} like above, but for all occurences
     *                          The syntax of the regexp and the replacement are the ones from kateparts regexp search/replace
     * ${something/regexp/replacement/i} like above, but case insensitive
     *                          The syntax of the regexp and the replacement are the ones from kateparts regexp search/replace
     * Possible flags: g and i. Those flags can be combined too
     * If a literal / should appear in the regexp, it has to be escaped \/,
     * literal \ has to be escaped too 
     * 
     * If you have mirrored ranges and want another occurence than the first one as the master
     * you can add @ directly after the placeholder name.
     * 
     * The interface2 version invokes the function specified by functionName within the script specified
     * by the scriptToken, if a placeholder is specified with backticks like
     * ${placeholder`functionName`}
     * The function has a global environment containing "view", "document" and "debug", at 
     * least in the katepart implementation. The function invokation is not allowed to be mixed with other replacements
     * 
     * If a / or ` replacement is done on a master the initial value is modified and therefor
     * also all mirrored placeholders are affected too, later on the replacement is not done anymore on master ranges
     * 
     *
     * The parameters for invoked javascript functions will be the following:
     * value of the master (or initial value), //to be done: placeholder name, small wrapper around the template handler (to do more sophisticated things, like adding additional placehlder points, aattaching custom properties for state keeping, ....) you tell
     *
     * 
     * Specification of initial values
     * You can specify initial values which are different from the placeholder name
     * this is done via, this makes only sense for $ placeholders, not for %
     * ${placeholder:some value} or ${placeholder@:some value}
     * It is not allowed to mix : and /
     * after the first  colon, everything is interpreted as default value, } in
     * the default value have to be escaped (backslashes before } have to be escaped themselves) and regexp searches are ignored. The : has to be
     * directly after the placeholder name or after an optional @ symbol.
     * 
     * 
     * Common placeholders and values are
     *
     * - index: "i"
     * - loginname: The current users's loginname
     * - firstname: The current user's first name retrieved from kabc
     * - lastname: The current user's last name retrieved from kabc
     * - fullname: The current user's first and last name retrieved from kabc
     * - email: The current user's primary email address retrieved from kabc
     * - date: current date
     * - time: current time
     * - year: current year
     * - month: current month
     * - day: current day
     * - hostname: hostname of the computer
     * - selection: The implementation should set this to the selected text, if any
     * - cursor: at this position the cursor will be after editing of the
     *   template has finished, this has to be taken care of by the actual
     *   implementation. The placeholder gets a value of "|" assigned.
     *
     * If a macro is started with a % (persent sign) like "%{date}" it isn't added
     * to the list editable strings ( for example TAB key navigation) if a value
     * differing from the macro name is found.
     *
     * If the editor supports some kind of smart indentation, the inserted code
     * should be layouted by the indenter.
