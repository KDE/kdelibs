/**
 * \brief A text widget with KXMLGUIClient that represents a Document.
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - \ref view_intro
 *  - \ref view_hook_into_gui
 *  - \ref view_selection
 *  - \ref view_cursors
 *  - \ref view_mouse_tracking
 *  - \ref view_modes
 *  - \ref view_extensions
 *
 * \section view_intro Introduction
 *
 * The View class represents a single view of a KTextEditor::Document,
 * get the document on which the view operates with document().
 * A view provides both the graphical representation of the text and the
 * KXMLGUIClient for the actions. The view itself does not provide
 * text manipulation, use the methods from the Document instead. The only
 * method to insert text is insertText(), which inserts the given text
 * at the current cursor position and emits the signal textInserted().
 *
 * Usually a view is created by using Document::createView().
 * Furthermore a view can have a context menu. Set it with setContextMenu()
 * and get it with contextMenu().
 *
 * \section view_hook_into_gui Merging the View's GUI
 *
 * A View is derived from the class KXMLGUIClient, so its GUI elements (like
 * menu entries and toolbar items) can be merged into the application's GUI
 * (or into a KXMLGUIFactory) by calling
 * \code
 * // view is of type KTextEditor::View*
 * mainWindow()->guiFactory()->addClient( view );
 * \endcode
 * You can add only one view as client, so if you have several views, you first
 * have to remove the current view, and then add the new one, like this
 * \code
 * mainWindow()->guiFactory()->removeClient( currentView );
 * mainWindow()->guiFactory()->addClient( newView );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section view_selection Text Selection
 *
 * As the view is a graphical text editor it provides \e normal and \e block
 * text selection. You can check with selection() whether a selection exists.
 * removeSelection() will remove the selection without removing the text,
 * whereas removeSelectionText() also removes both, the selection and the
 * selected text. Use selectionText() to get the selected text and
 * setSelection() to specify the selected textrange. The signal
 * selectionChanged() is emitted whenever the selecteion changed.
 *
 * \section view_cursors Cursor Positions
 *
 * A view has one Cursor which represents a line/column tuple. Two different
 * kinds of cursor positions are supported: first is the \e real cursor
 * position where a \e tab character only counts one character. Second is the
 * \e virtual cursor position, where a \e tab character counts as many
 * spaces as defined. Get the real position with cursorPosition() and the
 * virtual position with cursorPositionVirtual(). Set the real cursor
 * position with setCursorPosition(). You can even get the screen coordinates
 * of the current cursor position in pixel by using
 * cursorPositionCoordinates(). The signal cursorPositionChanged() is emitted
 * whenever the cursor position changed.
 *
 * \section view_mouse_tracking Mouse Tracking
 *
 * It is possible to get notified via the signal mousePositionChanged() for
 * mouse move events, if mouseTrackingEnabled() returns \e true. Mouse tracking
 * can be turned on/off by calling setMouseTrackingEnabled(). If an editor
 * implementation does not support mouse tracking, mouseTrackingEnabled() will
 * always return \e false.
 *
 * \section view_modes Edit Modes
 *
 * A view supports several edit modes (EditMode). Common edit modes are
 * \e insert-mode (INS) and \e overwrite-mode (OVR). Which edit modes the
 * editor supports depends on the implementation, another well-known mode is
 * the \e command-mode for example in vim and yzis. The getter viewMode()
 * returns a string like \p INS or \p OVR and is represented in the user
 * interface for example in the status bar. Further you can get the edit
 * mode as enum by using viewEditMode(). Whenever the edit mode changed the
 * signals viewModeChanged() and viewEditModeChanged() are emitted.
 *
 * \section view_extensions View Extension Interfaces
 *
 * A simple view represents the text of a Document and provides a text cursor,
 * text selection, edit modes etc.
 * Advanced concepts like code completion and text hints are defined in the
 * extension interfaces. An KTextEditor implementation does not need to
 * support all the extensions. To implement the interfaces multiple
 * inheritance is used.
 *
 * More information about interfaces for the view can be found in
 * \ref kte_group_view_extensions.
 *
 * \see KTextEditor::Document, KTextEditor::TemplateInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::CodeCompletionInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface, KTextEditor::TemplateInterface,
