/**
 * \brief A KParts derived class representing a text document.
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - \ref doc_intro
 *  - \ref doc_manipulation
 *  - \ref doc_views
 *  - \ref doc_extensions
 *
 * \section doc_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Document class represents a pure text document providing methods to
 * modify the content and create views. A document can have any number
 * of views, each view representing the same content, i.e. all views are
 * synchronized. Support for text selection is handled by a View and text
 * format attributes by the Attribute class.
 *
 * To load a document call KParts::ReadOnlyPart::openUrl().
 * To reload a document from a file call documentReload(), to save the
 * document call documentSave() or documentSaveAs(). Whenever the modified
 * state of the document changes the signal modifiedChanged() is emitted.
 * Check the modified state with KParts::ReadWritePart::isModified().
 * Further signals are documentUrlChanged(). The encoding can be specified
 * with setEncoding(), however this will only take effect on file reload and
 * file save.
 *
 * \section doc_manipulation Text Manipulation
 *
 * Get the whole content with text() and set new content with setText().
 * Call insertText() or insertLine() to insert new text or removeText()
 * and removeLine() to remove content. Whenever the document's content
 * changed the signal textChanged() is emitted. Additional signals are
 * textInserted() and textRemoved(). Note, that the first line in the
 * document is line 0.
 *
 * If the editor part supports it, a document provides full undo/redo history.
 * Text manipulation actions can be grouped together using startEditing()
 * and endEditing(). All actions in between are grouped together to only one
 * undo/redo action. Due to internal reference counting you can call
 * startEditing() and endEditing() as often as you wish, but make sure you
 * call endEditing() exactly as often as you call startEditing(), otherwise
 * the reference counter gets confused.
 *
 * \section doc_views Document Views
 *
 * A View displays the document's content. As already mentioned, a document
 * can have any number of views, all synchronized. Get a list of all views
 * with views(). Only one of the views can be active (i.e. has focus), get
 * it by using activeView(). Create a new view with createView(). Every time
 * a new view is created the signal viewCreated() is emitted.
 *
 * \section doc_extensions Document Extension Interfaces
 *
 * A simple document represents text and provides text manipulation methods.
 * However, a real text editor should support advanced concepts like session
 * support, textsearch support, bookmark/general mark support etc. That is why
 * the KTextEditor library provides several additional interfaces to extend
 * a document's capabilities via multiple inheritance.
 *
 * More information about interfaces for the document can be found in
 * \ref kte_group_doc_extensions.
 *
 * \see KParts::ReadWritePart, KTextEditor::Editor, KTextEditor::View,
 *      KTextEditor::MarkInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::ModificationInterface, KTextEditor::SearchInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface, KTextEditor::SmartInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::VariableInterface
