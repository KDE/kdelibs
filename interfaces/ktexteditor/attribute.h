/**
 * \brief A class which provides customized text decorations.
 *
 * The Attribute class extends QTextCharFormat, the class which Qt
 * uses internally to provide formatting information to characters
 * in a text document.
 *
 * In addition to its inherited properties, it provides support for:
 * \li several customized text formatting properties
 * \li dynamic highlighting of associated ranges of text
 * \li binding of actions with associated ranges of text (note: not currently implemented)
 *
 * Implementations are not required to support all properties.
 * In particular, several properties are not supported for dynamic
 * highlighting (notably: font() and fontBold()).
 *
 * Unfortunately, as QTextFormat's setProperty() is not virtual,
 * changes that are made to this attribute cannot automatically be
 * redrawn.  Once you have finished changing properties, you should
 * call changed() to force redrawing of affected ranges of text.
 *
