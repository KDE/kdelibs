/**
 * \brief Accessor to the Editor implementation.

 * Topics:

 *  - \ref factory_example
 *  - \ref factory_notes
 *
 * \section factory_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Factory provides access to the chosen Editor (selected with
 * KTextEditor::EditorChooser). The Editor itself then provides methods
 * to handle documents and config options.
 *
 * To access the Editor use editor().
 *
 * Each KTextEditor implementation must reimplement this factory to allow
 * access to the editor object.
 *
 * \section factory_example Creating an Editor Part
 * To get a kate part the following code snippet can be used:
 * \code
 * KPluginLoader loader("katepart");
 * KPluginFactory* factory = loader.factory();
 * KTextEditor::Factory* kte_factory =
 *     qobject_cast<KTextEditor::Factory*>(factory);
 *
 * if(kte_factory) {
 *     // valid editor factory, it is possible to access the editor now
 *     KTextEditor::Editor* editor = kte_factory->editor();
 * } else {
 *     // error
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If another editor part is desired substitue the string "katepart" with the
 * corresponding library name.
 *
 * However, if you are only interested in getting the editor part (which is
 * usually the case) a simple call of
 * \code
 * KTextEditor::Editor* editor = KTextEditor::editor("katepart");
 * \endcode
 * is enough.
 *
 * \section factory_notes Notes
 * It is recommend to use the EditorChooser to get the used editor part. This
 * way the user can choose the editor implementation. The Factory itself is
 * not needed to get the Editor with the help of the EditorChooser.
