/** @mainpage KDE Initialization Routines

kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the
famous init used for booting UNIX.
<p>
It launches processes by forking and then loading a
dynamic library which should contain a 'main(...)'
function.  This both increases the startup speed and
reduces the memory consumption of KDE applications.

kdeinit_wrapper, kshell and kwrapper provide methods
of starting programs via kdeinit.
