/**
 * @short A re-implementation of QGraphicsWebView that provides KDE integration.
 *
 * This is a drop-in replacement for QGraphicsWebView that provides full KDE
 * integration through the use of @ref KWebPage. It also provides signals that
 * capture middle, shift and ctrl mouse clicks on links and URL pasting from the
 * selection clipboard.
 *
 * The specific functionality provided by this class (over and above what
 * would be acheived by using KWebPage with a QGraphicsWebView) is that
 * scrolling * with the mouse wheel while holding down CTRL zooms the page (see
 * QGraphicsWebView::setZoomFactor) and several useful signals are emitted when
 * the user performs certain actions.
