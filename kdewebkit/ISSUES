Known Issues [PENDING]:
===========================
* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not properly work for most users depending
  on how their distro created their Qt library package. As a result of differences
  between the Phonon library needed by KDE and bundled with Qt, most distros opt for
  disabling Phonon support (-no-phonon) when compiling Qt and simply use the Phonon
  libraries from kdesupport to ensure multimedia in KDE is functional. Unfortunately,
  compiling Qt without phonon support means no HTML 5 <video> support in the QtWebKit
  module. This is supposed to change in some future release, perhaps QtWebKit 2.1 ??
  For more details see the links below:

    http://webkit.org/b/34631.

* [QtWebKit] Spell checking support. See http://webkit.org/b/44114.

* [QtWebKit] Missing Java applet support. See http://webkit.org/b/33044.

* [QtWebKit] No access to the input/control widgets making it very difficult to
  implement very useful features such as form completion like the one available
  when using native Qt widgets, e.g. QLineEdit. See http://webkit.org/b/36668

* [kdewebkit] Handling unsupported content always requires more than one
  connection to the same server to download a single request. The fix for
  this requires an upstream patch that allows us to determine the content
  types by the rendering engine, i.e. webkit. See http://webkit.org/b/37880

Known Issues [FIXED]:
=========================
* [QtWebKit] Crash while browsing facebook. [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  See http://webkit.org/b/35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  Specifically when it contains the keyword "attachement" the content returned
  is not supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See http://webkit.org/b/36395.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop <meta> tag based page refresh. [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  See http://webkit.org/b/29899
