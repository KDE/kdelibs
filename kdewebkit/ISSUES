Known Issues [PENDING]:
=======================
* [QtWebKit] Form completion like the one available in native Qt widgets such
  as QLineEdit is missing due to lack of access to form elements.
  See http://webkit.org/b/36668.

Known Issues [FIXED]:
=====================
* [kdewebkit] Proper support for putting ioslaves on hold. [KDE 4.6]
  Handling unsupported content always requires more than one connection to the
  same server to download a single request. The upstream change requested,
  http://webkit.org/b/37880, turned out to be the wrong solution. The issue has
  now been correctly addressed within KDE itself. You can find the details of
  the fix at http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6182/ & http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6183/

* [QtWebKit] Missing Java applet support. [QtWebKit 2.1*]
  See http://webkit.org/b/33044.

* [QtWebKit] Crash while browsing facebook. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  Specifically when it contains the keyword "attachement" the content returned
  is not supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See http://webkit.org/b/36395.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop <meta> tag based page refresh. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/29899

* [QtWebKit] Spell checking support. See https://webkit.org/b/44114 [ QtWebKit > 2.2 ]
  Some support was implemented but did not quite make it into QtWebKit 2.2.0 branch.
  It will be in future released. However, it was determined that spell checking
  support can easily be implemented at the browser level. Consult the specific browser
  engine, e.g. kwebkitpart, for details.

* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not properly work for most users depending [ QtWebKit >= 2.2 ]
  on how their distro created their Qt library package. As a result of differences
  between the Phonon library needed by KDE and bundled with Qt, most distros opt for
  disabling Phonon support (-no-phonon) when compiling Qt and simply use the Phonon
  libraries from kdesupport to ensure multimedia in KDE is functional. Unfortunately,
  compiling Qt without phonon support means no HTML 5 <video> support in QtWebKit.
  See http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTWEBKIT-9 and http://webkit.org/b/34631.

* [QtWebKit] HTML access key support has not yet been implemented in QtWebKit. [ N/A ]
  This functionality was something that was deemed to be browser specific and
  should be implemented at that level.

NOTES:
======
** Qt 4.7.x comes with QtWebkit 2.0.x
** Qt 4.8.x comes with QtWebKit 2.2.x
