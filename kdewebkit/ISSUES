Known Issues [PENDING]:
=======================
* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not properly work for most users depending
  on how their distro created their Qt library package. As a result of differences
  between the Phonon library needed by KDE and bundled with Qt, most distros opt for
  disabling Phonon support (-no-phonon) when compiling Qt and simply use the Phonon
  libraries from kdesupport to ensure multimedia in KDE is functional. Unfortunately,
  compiling Qt without phonon support means no HTML 5 <video> support in QtWebKit.
  This is supposed to change in some future release, perhaps QtWebKit 2.1 ?? For
  more details see:
    http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTWEBKIT-9
    http://webkit.org/b/34631.

* [QtWebKit] Spell checking support. See https://webkit.org/b/44114

* [QtWebKit] No access to the input/control widgets making it very difficult to
  implement very useful features such as form completion like the one available
  when using native Qt widgets, e.g. QLineEdit. See http://webkit.org/b/36668

Known Issues [FIXED]:
=====================
* [kdewebkit] Proper support for putting ioslaves on hold. [KDE 4.6]
  Handling unsupported content always requires more than one connection to the
  same server to download a single request. The upstream change requested,
  http://webkit.org/b/37880, turned out to be the wrong solution. The issue has
  now been correctly addressed within KDE itself. You can find the details of
  the fix at http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6182/ & http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/6183/

* [QtWebKit] Missing Java applet support. [QtWebKit 2.1*]
  See http://webkit.org/b/33044.

* [QtWebKit] Crash while browsing facebook. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  Specifically when it contains the keyword "attachement" the content returned
  is not supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See http://webkit.org/b/36395.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop <meta> tag based page refresh. [QtWebKit 2.0**]
  See http://webkit.org/b/29899











NOTES:
======
** Qt 4.7.X comes with QtWebkit 2.0.
