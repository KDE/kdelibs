<H2>Porting Applications to KDE 2.0</H2>
<H3>Last Modified on November 28, 2000</H3>
This document contains the changes you have to apply to programs written for
KDE1.1 when you want to port them to KDE2.0.<P>

As a start you should have a look at doc/porting.doc in the Qt package,
or <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/porting.html">this page online</a>.<P>

<H3><A NAME="gettingstarted">Getting started</A></H3>

  The first step to get your KDE application to compile under KDE 2.0,
  is to detect KDE 2.0 and Qt 2.x at configure time. The easiest way to
  get a working autoconf/automake framework, is to either use 
  <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org">KDevelop</a> or
  <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~granroth/kapptemplate/index.html">kapptemplate</a>
  (available in CVS under the module "kdesdk"), to generate a new
  application template. Replace the generated source files by yours
  and adapt Makefile.am accordingly.

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="general">Global changes</A></H3>

  We did our best to clean up the header files of kdelibs, so they do
  not include unnecessary bloat for your application. As a consequence, you
  may notice that some header files are missing from your source files as
  they have been included before by kapp.h for example. There is a script
  in kdesdk/scripts called "fixheaders" that takes care of most of these
  cases. Just call "make -k 2&gt;&amp;1 | perl .../fixheaders" and it will try
  to look after the error messages and add includes as it recognize the
  errors.<P>

  Also, if your code does not compile and complains about missing member
  functions, you should check for methods that started with get...().
  These methods have been renamed to xy*() for consistency.<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="automoc">automoc/am_edit, Makefile.am tags</A></H3>

  On the subject of the compilation framework, automoc has been removed from
  the admin directory. It has been replaced by am_edit which provides a lot of
  additional features.<P>
  METASOURCES=AUTO still does the job of generating the appropriate moc files,
  but in addition, you should use KDE_ICON for the icons representing the application
  (and naming those icons conforming to lo16-app-&lt;appname&gt;.png), and install
  the application-specific icons under $(kde_datadir)/&lt;appname&gt;/pics.

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KApplication">KApplication</A></H3>

  doesn't hold any longer a KLocale instance. With this getLocale()
  and isLocaleInstantiated are now replaced by KGlobal::locale()<P>

  it also doesn't hold a KiconLoader instance. As this also getIconLoader()
  has been removed. Replace kapp-&gt;getIconLoader()-&gt;loadIcon() with
  BarIcon() or use KGlobal::iconLoader() instead of getIconLoader()<P>

  kde_*dir() have been removed as they require a unique top level directory
  for all applications (KDEDIR). This concept doesn't exist in KDE 2.0
  any more, it has been replaced with "multiple levels of directories",
  set in KDEDIRS, so that it's possible to have global settings and
  group settings, applied before user settings.<P>

  Replace code that uses kde_*dir() + filename with calls to
  locate(filetype, filename) where filetype is what * used to be
  in kde_*dir(). locate is defined as function in kstddirs.h to call
  KGlobal::dirs()-&gt;findResource.<P>

  Use locateLocal to get the path of a writable file. For instance,
  KApplication::localconfigdir()+filename is now locateLocal( "config", filename ),
  but for most cases, simply using KGlobal::config() is enough, if you're happy
  with saving the application's configuration into appnamerc, or
  KSimpleConfig cfg("anothercfgfile") to create a config file with another name.<P>

  generalFont() and fixedFont() are deprecated and will be removed soon.
  Please use KGlobalSettings::generalFont() and KGlobalSettings::fixedFont() instead.<P>

  appName() is deprecated. Please use QApplication::name() or instanceName
  instead.<P>

  The methods tempSaveName() and checkRecoverFile() return QString
  now. The returned values must _not_ be free()d.<P>

  helpMenu() has been moved to KMainWindow. aboutKDE(), aboutApp() and
  appHelpActivated() have all been removed See section for KMainWindow
  for more info.<P>

  The KApplication constructor has changed. Command line arguments and
  program name should no longer be passed to KApplication but to 
  KCmdLineArgs. KCmdLineArgs performs command line parsing and a command
  line help. See below for more info.<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KCmdLineArgs">KCmdLineArgs</A></H3>

  KCmdLineArgs is a new class that handles command line parsing and
  command line help. It is now required that your application
  specifies at least:<P>
  <UL>
	<LI>Its name.
	<LI>A short description what it does. (e.g. 1 line)
	<LI>A version.
	<LI>All command line options that it supports.
  </UL>
 
  KCmdLineArgs itself will add the command line options supported by Qt 
  and KApplication.<P>

  You can also use the KAboutData class to specify name, description and 
  version.<P>

  In return for this information you can query KCmdLineArgs whether an 
  certain option was specified on the command line and your application 
  now automatically supports --help and --version. It aborts with a
  useful error message when the command line contains a syntax error.
  See kdelibs/kdecore/kcmdlineargs.h for more info.<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KLocale">KLocale</A></H3>

  i18n is no longer a macro<P>

  KApplication::getApplication()-&gt;getLocale()-&gt;translate<P>

  but a function on its own. klocale is obsolete and replace every call
  to klocale-&gt;translate with i18n.<P>

  The return value of i18n is also no longer a const char*,
  but a unicode QString.<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KGlobal">KGlobal: access to KDE global objects.</A></H3>

KGlobal allows centralized access to KDE global objects without including
extraneous headers. object creation is deferred if possible.<P>

All methods are static and headers for returned types are not included. You
must have created a KApplication object before the methods can be used.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KIconLoader">KIconLoader</A></H3>

KIconLoader in 1.1 used to mix icons for applications and for toolbars.
This has changed, so you may notice that your application doesn't find
the right icons. loadIcon (used by BarIcon) returns only toolbar icons.<P>
If you need icons for applications, use loadApplicationIcon.<P>
loadMiniIcon and loadApplicationMiniIcon have been removed, instead
loadApplicationIcon now takes a "size" argument where you can specify the
size of the icon (small, medium, large).<P>
The other big change you may notice, is that ICON and Icon have been
removed as they caused big confusion for not loading application icons
(see above). For this we added BarIcon which does the same as ICON before.
The third change in this row is that loadIcon doesn't need the extension
anymore, but looks for standard extensions (png, xpm) itself. If you hard-
coded .xpm, loadIcon will issue a warning at runtime, but will still work
in stripping off the .xpm part<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KTMainWindow">KTMainWindow</A></H3>

KTMainWindow has been replaced with KMainWindow.<p>

The KMainWindow constructor needs a parent widget as first argument. 
You can use 0 for this.<p>
setView() has been replaced with setCentralWidget().<p>
view() has been replaced with centralWidget().<p>
addToolBar() has been removed, it is not needed any more.<p>
setMenu(...) has been removed, it is not needed any more.<p>
setStatusBar(...) has been removed, it is not needed any more.<p>
updateRects() has been removed, it is not needed any more.<p>
enableStatusBar(...) has been removed, use statusBar()-&gt;show() and/or
statusBar()-&gt;hide() instead.<p>
enableToolBar(...) has been removed, use toolBar()-&gt;show() and/or 
toolBar()-&gt;hide() instead. <p>

view_* public variables do no longer exist. There is really no reason
for an app to use this information. If you do need it anyway, use
mainViewGeometry() instead.<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KHelpMenu">KHelpMenu</A></H3>

helpMenu() has been moved to KMainWindow from KApplication (kapp).<P>

Both the "About KDE" and the "About &lt;Application&gt;" dialog boxes
are now modeless. "About KDE" is a completely new widget.<P>

If you used in the toplevel window (that is derived from KMainWindow)
"kapp-&gt;helpMenu( bool, QString )" to get the help menu
you must now change this to "helpMenu( QString )". The QString defaults
to QString::null so it is sufficient to write helpMenu().<P>

The old aboutKDE(), aboutApp() and appHelpActivated() of KApplication
have all been removed. If you need direct access to these or need
access to a help menu in a class that is not derived from
KMainWindow then allocate an instance of the new class KHelpMenu.
See KDE 2.0 API reference or khelpmenu.h (kdeui) for additional info.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KToolBar">KToolBar</A></H3>

enable(...) is depreciated, use show()/hide() instead.<p>
enableFloating(...) has been removed, use enableMoving() instead.<p>
setMaxHeight() is depreciated, use setMaximumHeight() instead.<p>
maxHeight() is depreciated, use maximumHeight() instead.<p>
setMaxWidth() is depreciated, use setMaximumWidth() instead.<p>
maxWidth() is depreciated, use maximumWidth() instead.<p>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="launching">Starting other programs</A></H3>

In KDE 2.0 there are several ways to start other programs from within
your application. Here is a short summary of your options with reasons why
you should or should not use them.
<H4>1. fork + exec</H4>
<P>
You never want to use this unless you have a very good reason why it is 
impossible to use KProcess.
</P>
<H4>2. KProcess</H4>
<P>
You want to use this if you need to start a new process which needs to be a 
child of your process, e.g. because you want to catch stdout/stderr or need 
to send it data via stdin. You should never use this to start other KDE 
applications unless your application is called kgdb :-) If you need to
send/receive text like data to/from the process, you are probably better 
off with KProcIO
</P>

<H4>3. KProcIO</H4>
<P>
Like KProcess. Unlike KProcess, this class actually makes it easy to 
send data to and receive data from the process.

</P>
<H4>4. startServiceByDesktopPath</H4>
<P>
Preferred way to launch desktop (KDE/Gnome/X) applications or KDE services. 
The application/service must have a .desktop file. It will make use of 
KDEinit for increased startup performance and lower memory usage. These 
benefits only apply to applications available as KDEinit loadable module (KLM)
</P>
<H4>5. KRun</H4>
<P>
Generic way to open documents/applications/shell commands. Uses
startServiceBy.... where applicable. Offers the additional 
benefit of startup-notification.<BR>
KRun can start any application, from the binary or the desktop file,
it will determine the mimetype of a file before running the
preferred handler for it, and it can also start shell commands.
This makes KRun the recommended way to run another program in KDE 2.
</P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="khtmlw">khtmlw</A></H3>

khtmlw has been replaced with khtml.<BR>
<UL>
	<LI>KHTMLView has vanished. Just use KHTMLWidget, which does scrollbar
  managing for free.

	<LI>A lot of the API has changed. If you just want to open a file/URL,
  you just need to do:<P>
  <PRE>
	KHTMLWidget *w = new KHTMLWidget();
	w-&gt;openURL(myURL);
  </PRE>

	<LI>khtml uses QString's instead of char *'s now. This means, that most
  of the api has changed. In all functions:<P>
  <PRE>
     const char * -&gt; QString
     QStrList -&gt; QStringList
  </PRE>
  The only exception for the moment is KHTMLWidget::write(), which does
  also exist in a const char * version.<P>


<LI>you won't need the getKHTMLWiget function anymore. Just replace
	getKHTMLWidget-&gt;xxx() with xxx()<P>
<LI>xxx(QString) -&gt; xxx(const QString &amp;)<P>

<H3><A NAME="KIntegerLine">KIntegerLine, KIntLineEdit</A></H3>

  KIntegerLine and KIntLineEdit  have been replaced by KIntNumInput.
  The new header file is called knuminput.h.<P>

  The new KIntNumInput can have an optional slider attached, ensures
  that the entered value is in a given range (use MAX_INT or similar
  if you don't care about the range) and can maintain a descriptive
  label and also a unit for the edited value.<P>

  The API is almost the same and it simplifies existing code a bit,
  so give it a try. If you need more functionality, please contact
  me, Dirk A. Mueller &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mueller@kde.org">mueller@kde.org</A>&gt;.<P>

  The additional class KDoubleNumInput gives you the same look &amp; feel,
  but allows you to edit floating point numbers.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KDNDIcon">KDNDIcon, KDNDDropZone, KDNDWidget, kdecore/drag.h</A></H3>

KDE Drag and Drop is Dead.  Long live Qt Xdnd.<P>

Xdnd is better anyway, because it has been adopted by all the other
major GUI toolkits still under active development (this precludes
Motif, but maybe we can convince the lesstif guys!).  Some changes
are necessary to convert your old KDND-based stuff to Qt DND.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Remove drag.h from all of your sources / header files.<P>
<LI>Remove KDNDDropZone object creations.  Instead of creating an
  object of this type and then connecting it to some arbitrary slot
  to handle drops, call "setAcceptDrops(true)" in your widget
  constructor and then override the protected methods dragEnterEvent,
  dragMoveEvent, dragLeaveEvent, and dropEvent.<P>
<LI>You should be aware that to handle drops, you will either have to
  inherit a widget and then override the methods mentioned above,
  or install an event handler for the widget in that widget's parent,
  and then handle QEvent::DragMove or QEvent::Drop inside there (if
  you want to avoid inheritance).<P>
<LI>You can emulate the old DndURL drop-type behavior with the Qt
  Drag Object type QUriList.<P>
<LI>You can start a drag from inside your widget's mouseMoveEvent
  method if you wish.<P>
<LI>Qt includes a Drag and Drop tutorial.  We suggest you read that
  now if you are confused.<P>
<LI>QMultiLineEdit has already a DnD interface that accepts text/*
  If you want to add support for other mimetypes, you need to
  re-implement all DnD-methods (also dragMoveEvent()) and pass
  QTextDrag's to the parent methods.<P>
<LI>QTextDrag also accepts text/uri-list, which means that you
  always need to check for QUriDrag first if you want to get
  both working.<P>
<LI>The mimetype for Uri's is now text/uri-list. If you've used
  the proprietary Qt 1.x url/url, you need to adjust that.
</UL>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KConfigBase">KConfigBase, KConfig, KSimpleConfig</A></H3>

  These classes have been largely re-implemented.  The external API
  remains mostly the same, with the single notable change that
  the groupIterator and entryIterator methods have been removed and
  instead replaced by groupList (which returns a QStringList of groups)
  and entryMap(const QString &amp;group) (which returns a QMap of entries
  in the specified group).  This is due to internal changes in KConfig
  which would make providing iterators possibly rather difficult.<P>

  Much more extensive documentation on the KConfig and friends API can
  be found in the kdoc generated documentation from the header files,
  and in kdecore/KCONFIG_DESIGN.<P>

  To use the new iterator, you will probably want to do something like
  this:<P>
  <PRE>

  QMap&lt;QString, QString&gt; tmpMap = config-&lt;entryMap(myGroup);
  QMap&lt;QString, QString&gt;::Iterator aIt(tmpMap.begin());

  for (; aIt != tmpMap.end(); ++aIt) {
   // body here.  Access iterator key as aIt.key(),

The kcharsets class has been completely rewritten, and most of it has

Most applications will only need to replace kapp-&gt;getKCharsets() with
KGlobal::charsets().<P>

For conversion of various input formats to QStrings, please have a
look at QTextCodec and classes derived from it.<P>

Character entities are now  converted from and to QChars. The name has
changed from convertTag to fromEntity and toEntity.<P>

To get a font, which can display a certain charset (if such a font
exists), you can use the KCharsets::setQFont methods. Input is a font and
a charset. Kcharsets tries to find an output font, which matches the
input font most closely, but can display the given charset.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KClipboard">KClipboard</A></H3>

KClipboard has been removed. In case you've been using KClipboard,
QClipboard is the way to go now, as it has all the functionality the K
version had, and more.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KPanner">KPanner, KNewPanner</A></H3>

KPanner and KNewPanner have been removed.  QSplitter does everything
KPanner did and more. The api is similar, but not compatible.
Basically to set it up so that you have a vertical splitter between a
listbox, a listview and multi line editor, you would do something like
this:<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
    QSplitter *split = new QSplitter( parent );<BR>
    QListBox *lb = new QListBox( split );<BR>
    KListView *lv = new KListView( split );<BR>
    QMultiLineEdit *ed = new QMultiLineEdit( split );
</TD></TR></TABLE>

As you can see you are not limited to two children.  Additionally, you
do not have to call activate when you are done, and opaque resizing is
possible if you call setOpaqueResize(true).<P>

<H4><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#TOC">Return to the Table of Contents</A></P></H4>

<H3><A NAME="KTreeList">KTreeList, KTreeListItem</A></H3>

Use KListView, QListViewItem instead. API is almost the same, you only
need to add a Column (KListView::addColum) before KListView is useable.<P>

KListView has no addChild(), insertItem() and removeItem() calls. Inserting
a root item is done by constructing a QListViewItem with the KListView
passed as the parent widget. adding a child item is done by constructing
a QListViewItem with the parent item as parameter. removeItem() should
be replaced by delete &lt;pointer to item&gt;.<P>

The root items are not shown in a tree fashion by default. to get this,
use KListView::setDecorativeRoot(true).<P>

Expanding and collapsing can by done by using QListViewItem::setOpen(bool).<P>

KMsgBox has been superseded by QMessageBox. Which has been superseded
by KMessageBox.<P>
<UL>
<LI>KMsgBox had return codes starting with 1 for the first button, 2 for
  the second, and so on.  KMessageBox defines an enum which you should
  use instead.

<H3><A NAME="KCombo">KCombo</A></H3>

KCombo has been removed.  Use KComboBox instead, it is completely
compatible with the old KCombo API.  The method that you may have problems
with is the old KCombo::setText.  This has been renamed to
KComboBox::setEditText.<P>

<H3><A NAME="KPixmapgradientFill">KPixmap::gradientFill</A></H3>

Instead of old KPixmap::gradientFill, use:<P>

KPixmapEffect::gradient(KPixmap&amp;, QColor, QColor, enum KPixmapEffect::GradientType, int)<P>

 Hence:<P>

pix.gradientFill(ca, cb, direction, ncols)<P>

becomes, for direction == true :<P>

KPixmapEffect::gradient(pix, ca, cb, KPixmapEffect::VerticalGradient, ncols)<P>

There are now:<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD align=top>

<H3><A NAME="kbutton">kbutton.h / KButton</A></H3>

Since Qt 2.0, the class QToolButton provides the functionality of
buttons that raise when the mouse is moved over them, so there is no
reason to have a class providing the same feature in KDE libs. All
occurrences of KButton in the KDE CVS have been replaced by QToolButtons,
but for applications not in the CVS it has to be done by the respective
developer. (<A HREF="mailto:mirko@kde.org">mirko@kde.org</A>)<P>

<H3><A NAME="kbuttonbox">kbuttonbox.h / KButtonBox</A></H3>

KButtonBox::Orientation has been removed in favor of Qt::Orientation.

<H3><A NAME="KWMModuleApplication">KWMModuleApplication libkdeui/kwmmapp.h</A></H3>

The KWMModuleApplication has been removed. Instead, use the class
KWinModule in libkdecore. The API is a bit cleaner but very similar,
so you will feel comfortable immediately. One of the advantages of
KWinModule is that it doesn't require a special KApplication
subclass. This lead to many problems and misunderstandings in the
past. KWinModule is now just an object that emits fancy signals (and
provides some useful lists, like the list of all managed windows).

<H3><A NAME="KDebug">kDebug</A></H3>

Use kdDebug, kdWarning, kdError, kdFatal to log debug output, warnings and
errors in a very flexible way. kdebug has been improved, and the API simplified.
kdesdk/scripts/kDebug2kdDebug.sh provides a script for automating the conversion.
Note that enabling/disabling debug output can now be done with kdebugdialog,
which can be found in kdebase. The hidden dialog on C+S+F12 no longer exists.
<P>
Also, note that qDebug and fprintf aren't disabled by -DNDEBUG, whereas kdDebug is.
One more reason to use kdDebug !

<H3><A NAME="KFileDialog">KFileDialog - General Stuff</A></H3>

The new (rewritten) KFileDialog (KFD) is a lot more like the new QFileDialog
but still looks quite different. Normally you may want to use the static
methods provided for convenience (getOpenFileName and getSaveFileName).
If you need special features you can configure the dialog extensively. Just
create an object and use the different methods. <P>

<H3><A NAME="KFileDialogPreview">KFileDialog - Preview Mode</A></H3>
There is also a new preview mode which is quite different to the one we had in
the KDE 1.x KFD. There are no preview modules you have to register but there
is a single method you can use to set a preview widget. This widget has to
inherit QWidget and you have to implement a slot (showPreview(const KURL &amp;)) 
in this class. This slot is called each time the selected file/dir changes.
In this slot you have to react appropriate (i.e. show the preview :). The
easiest way this can be done is to derive your class from QWidgetStack and 
add a Object (derived from QWidget) for each file type. In the showPreview
method you just raise the matching widget. If you can't find an appropriate
widget just hide() the widget stack.<P>
If you need some "inspiration" on how that could be done, please have a look
at koffice/lib/kofficecore/koFilterManager.cc (PreviewStack).<P>

<H3><A NAME="KAudio">KAudio (kaudio.h)</A></H3>
The KAudio class no longer exists. Here are your options for porting.
<p>
<ul>
<li>notifications like "you have got new mail"
<p>
The way to go for this one is to use the KNotify API, which will allow
users to reconfigure how your application should sound. On the other hand,
they will also be able to disable specific sounds, rather let the events
log to a file, and so on. You can provide an rc file with the default
configuration. (Include "knotifyclient.h" and use the KNotifyClient class).
<p>
<li>very simple cases
<p>
On the other hand, if you just want a really small solution, there is the
KAudioPlayer class (declared kaudioplayer.h), which has a static member
function for playing, like
<p>
<pre>
   KAudioPlayer::play("/var/samples/foo.wav");
</pre>
<p>
<li>multimedia apps
<p>
If you are writing "real multimedia apps", you may also have a look at the
even more advanced sound/multimedia support, that using the aRts/MCOP
libraries directly can offer you.
