HOWTO Make KDED Modules.

KDED Modules are very similar to modules for the control center. A KDED Module
is loaded when a call is made to it.

A KDED Module needs to provide a factory method that creates an object that
is derived from KDEDModule. The name of a factory method always starts with 
"create_".

It also needs to provide a desktop file that defines the service provided by
the module. The desktop file needs to be installed under 
$KDEDIR/share/services/kded/. The name of the desktop file must match with 
the name of the DCOP object that is implemented by the module.

The desktop file needs to define the library in which the module is 
implemented. The name of the library always starts with libkded_.

The kdelibs/kio/kded/test/ directory contains a sample implementation.
