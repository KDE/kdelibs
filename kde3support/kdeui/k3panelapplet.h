/**
 * @short %KDE Panel Applet class
 *
 * Panel applets
 *   @li Are small applications living in the %KDE panel.
 *   @li Are implemented as DSOs (Dynamic Shared Objects).
 *
 * Note: For security and stability reasons the panel won't load
 * untrusted third party applets directly into its namespace but via an
 * external wrapper process.
 *
 * The panel locates available applets by searching for applet desktop
 * files in (ALL_DIRS)/share/apps/kicker/applets. Every panel applet should
 * install a desktop file there to be recognized by the panel.
 *
 * Besides standard keys like "Name", "Comment" and "Icon" there are
 * two panel applet specific keys:
 *
 * \b X-KDE-Library \n
 *
 * Used by the panel to locate the applet DSO (Dynamic Shared Object)
 * Example: X-KDE-Library=libexampleapplet
 *
 * \b X-KDE-UniqueApplet \n
 *
 * Similar to KApplication and KUniqueApplication there are
 * two types of panel applets. Use unique applets when it makes no
 * sence to run more than one instance of a applet in the panel. A
 * good example for unique applets is the taskbar applet.  Use normal
 * applets when you need instance specific configuration. An example
 * is the koolclock applet where you might want to run two instances
 * in your panel, one configured as analog clock, the other one as
 * digital clock. X-KDE-UniqueApplet is a boolean key which defaults
 * to "false".  Example: X-KDE-UniqueApplet=true
 *
 * Back to panel applet DSOs, the following conventions are used for %KDE:
 * Name:    lib<appletname>applet.la
 * LDFLAGS: -module -no-undefined
 *
 * To implement a panel applet it is not enough to write a class
 * inheriting from K3PanelApplet but you also have to provide a
 * factory function in your DSO.  A sample factory function could look
 * like this:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * extern "C"
 * {
 *     K3PanelApplet* init(QWidget *parent, const QString& configFile)
 *     {
 *         KGlobal::locale()->insertCatalog("exampleapplet");
 *         return new ExampleApplet(configFile, K3PanelApplet::Normal,
 *                       K3PanelApplet::About | K3PanelApplet::Help | K3PanelApplet::Preferences,
 *                       parent, "exampleapplet");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note: Don't change the factory function signature or the panel will
 * fail to load your applet.
