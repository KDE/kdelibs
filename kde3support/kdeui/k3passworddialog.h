/**
 * @short A password input dialog.
 *
 * This dialog asks the user to enter a password. The functions you're
 * probably interested in are the static methods, getPassword() and
 * getNewPassword().
 *
 * <b>Usage example</b>\n
 *
 * \code
 * QCString password;
 * int result = K3PasswordDialog::getPassword(parent, password, i18n("Prompt message"));
 * if (result == K3PasswordDialog::Accepted)
 *     use(password);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \image html k3passworddialog.png "KDE Password Dialog"
 *
 * <b>Security notes:</b>\n
 *
 * Keeping passwords in memory can be a potential security hole. You should
 * handle this situation with care.
 *
 * @li You may want to use disableCoreDump() to disable core dumps.
 * Core dumps are dangerous because they are an image of the process memory,
 * and thus include any passwords that were in memory.
 *
 * @li You should delete passwords as soon as they are not needed anymore.
 * The functions getPassword() and getNewPassword() return the
 * password as a QCString. I believe this is safer than a QString. A QString
 * stores its characters internally as 16-bit wide values, so conversions are
 * needed, both for creating the QString and by using it. The temporary
 * memory used for these conversion is probably not erased. This could lead
 * to stray  passwords in memory, even if you think you erased all of them.
