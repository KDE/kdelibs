/**
 * The K3TempFile class creates and opens a unique file for temporary use.
 *
 * This is especially useful if you need to create a file in a world
 * writable directory like /tmp without being vulnerable to so called
 * symlink attacks.
 *
 * KDE applications, however, shouldn't create files in /tmp in the first
 * place but use the "tmp" resource instead. The standard K3TempFile
 * constructor will do that by default.
 *
 * To create a temporary file that starts with a certain name
 * in the "tmp" resource, one should use:
 * K3TempFile(locateLocal("tmp", prefix), extension);
 *
 * K3TempFile does not create any missing directories, but locateLocal() does.
 *
 * See also KStandardDirs
 *
 * @deprecated Use QTemporaryFile instead.
