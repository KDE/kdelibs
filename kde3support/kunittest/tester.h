 *
 * KUnitTest is based on the "in reality no one wants to write tests and
 * if it takes a lot of code no one will. So the less code to write the
 * better" design principle.
 *
 * Copyright and credits:
 * @li (C) 2004 Zack Rusin (original author)
 * @li Brad Hards (import into CVS)
 * @li (C) 2005 Jeroen Wijnhout (GUI, library, module)
 *
 * You are responsible for what you do with it though. It
 * is licensed under a BSD license - read the top of each file.
 *
 * All the GUI related stuff is in kdesdk/kunittest, the core libraries are in kdelibs/kunittest.
 * A simple example modules is in kdelisbs/kunittest/samplemodule.{h,cpp}, however more examples
 * can be found in kdesdk/kunittest/example.
 *
 * There are roughly two ways to use the KUnitTest library. Either you create dynamically
 * loadable modules and use the kunittestmodrunner or kunittestguimodrunner programs to run
 * the tests, or you use the kunittest/kunittestgui library to create your own test runner
 * application.
 *
 * The main parts of the KUnitTest library are:
 * @li runner.{h,cpp} - it is the tester runner, holds all tests and runs
 * them.
 * @li runnergui.{h,cpp} - the GUI wrapper around the runner. The GUI neatly organizes the
 *   test results. With the kunittest helper script it can even add the debug output
 *   to the test results. For this you need to have the kdesdk module installed.
 * @li tester.h - which holds the base of a pure test object (Tester).
 * @li module.h - defines macros to create a dynamically loadable module.
 *
 * @section usage Example usage
 *
 * This section describes how to use the library to create your own tests and runner
 * application.
 *
 * Now lets see how you would add a new test to KUnitTest. You do that by
 * writing a Tester derived class which has an "allTests()" method:
 *
 * @code
 * class SampleTest : public Tester
 * {
 * public:
 *    SampleTest();
 *
 *    void allTests();
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now in the allTests() method we implement our tests, which might look
 * like:
 *
 * @code
 * void SampleTest::allTests()
 * {
 *    CHECK( 3+3, 6 );
 *    CHECK( QString( "hello%1" ).arg( " world not" ), QString( "hello world" ) );
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * CHECK is implemented using a template, so you get type safe
 * comparison. All that is needed is that the argument types have an
 * operator==() defined.
 *
 * Now that you did that the only other thing to do is to tell the
 * framework to add this test case, by using the KUNITTEST_REGISTER_TESTER(x) macro. Just
 * put the following line in the implementation file:
 *
 * @code KUNITTEST_REGISTER_TESTER( SampleTest ); @endcode
 *
 * Note the ;, it is necessary.
 *
 * KUnitTest will do the rest. It will tell you which tests failed, how, what was the expected
 * result, what was the result it got, what was the code that failed and so on. For example for
 * the code above it would output:
 *
 * @verbatim
SampleTest - 1 test passed, 1 test failed
    Unexpected failure:
        sampletest.cpp[38]: failed on "QString( "hello%1" ).arg( " world not" )"
            result = 'hello world not', expected = 'hello world'
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you use the RunnerGUI class then you will be presented with a scrollable list of the
 * test results.
 *
 * @section integration Integration
 *
 * The KUnitTest library is easy to use. Let's say that you have the tests written in the
 * sampletest.h and sampletest.cpp files. Then all you need is a main.cpp file and a Makefile.am.
 * You can copy both from the example file provided with the library. A typical main.cpp file
 * looks like this:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <kaboutdata.h>
 * #include <kapplication.h>
 * #include <kcmdlineargs.h>
 * #include <kcmdlineargs.h>
 * #include <klocalizedstring.h>
 * #include <kunittest/runnergui.h>
 *
 * static const char description[] = I18N_NOOP("SampleTests");
 * static const char version[] = "0.1";
 * static KCmdLineOptions options[] = { KCmdLineLastOption };
 *
 * int main( int argc, char** argv )
 * {
 *     KAboutData about("SampleTests", 0, ki18n("SampleTests"), version, ki18n(description),
 *                     KAboutData::License_BSD, ki18n("(C) 2005 You!"), KLocalizedString(), 0, "mail@provider");
 *
 *     KCmdLineArgs::init(argc, argv, &about);
 *     KCmdLineArgs::addCmdLineOptions( options );
 *     KApplication app;
 *
 *     KUnitTest::RunnerGUI runner(0);
 *     runner.show();
 *     app.setMainWidget(&runner);
 *
 *     return app.exec();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Makefile.am file will look like:
 *
 * @code
 * INCLUDES = -I$(top_srcdir)/src $(all_includes)
 * METASOURCES = AUTO
 * check_PROGRAMS = sampletests
 * sampletests_SOURCES = main.cpp sampletest.cpp
 * sampletests_LDFLAGS = $(KDE_RPATH) $(all_libraries)
 * sampletests_LDADD = -lkunittest
 * noinst_HEADERS = sampletest.h
 *
 * check:
 *    kunittest $(top_builddir)/src/sampletests SampleTests
 * @endcode
 *
 * Most of this Makefile.am will be self-explanatory. After running
 * "make check" the binary "sampletests" will be built. The reason for
 * adding the extra make target "check" is that you probably do not want
 * to rebuild the test suite every time you run make.
 *
 * You can run the binary on its own, but you get more functionality if you use
 * the kunittest helper script. The Makefile.am is set up in such
 * a way that this helper script is automatically run after you do a
 * "make check". This scripts take two arguments, the first is the path
 * to the binary to run. The second the application name, in this case SampleTests.
 * This name is important since it is used to let the script communicate with the application
 * via DCOP. The helper scripts relies on the Perl DCOP bindings, so these need to be installed.
 *
 * @section module Creating test modules
 *
 * If you think that writing your own test runner if too much work then you can also
 * use the kunittestermodrunner application or the kunitguimodrunner script to run
 * the tests for you. You do have to put your tests in a dynamically loadable module though.
 * Fortunately KUnitTest comes with a few macros to help you do this.
 *
 * First the good news, you don't have to change the header file sampletest.h. However, we
 * will rename it to samplemodule.h, so we remember we are making a module. The
 * implementation file should be rename to samplemodule.cpp. This file requires some
 * modifications. First we need to include the module.h header:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <kunittest/module.h>
 * @endcode
 *
 * This header file is needed because it defines some macro you'll need. In fact this is
 * how you use them:
 *
 * @code
 * KUNITTEST_MODULE( kunittest_samplemodule, "Tests for sample module" );
 * KUNITTEST_MODULE_REGISTER_TESTER( SimpleSampleTester );
 * KUNITTEST_MODULE_REGISTER_TESTER( SomeSampleTester );
 * @endcode
 *
 * The first macro, KUNITTEST_MODULE, makes sure that the module can be loaded and that
 * the test classes are created. The first argument "kunittest_samplemodule" is the library
 * name, in this case the library we're creating a kunittest_samplemodule.la module. The
 * second argument is name which will appear in the test runner for this test suite.
 *
 * The tester class are now added by the KUNITTEST_MODULE_REGISTER_TESTER macro, not the
 * KUNITTEST_REGISTER_TESTER. The only difference between the two is that you have to
 * pass the module class name to this macro.
 *
 * The Makefile.am is also a bit different, but not much:
 *
 * @code
 * INCLUDES = -I$(top_srcdir)/include $(all_includes)
 * METASOURCES = AUTO
 * check_LTLIBRARIES = kunittest_samplemodule.la
 * kunittest_samplemodule_la_SOURCES = samplemodule.cpp
 * kunittest_samplemodule_la_LIBADD = $(LIB_KUNITTEST)
 * kunittest_samplemodule_la_LDFLAGS = -module $(KDE_CHECK_PLUGIN) $(all_libraries)
 * @endcode
 *
 * The $(KDE_CHECK_PLUGIN) macro is there to make sure a dynamically loadable
 * module is created.
 *
 * After you have built the module you open a Konsole and cd into the build folder. Running
 * the tests in the module is now as easy as:
 *
 * @code
 * $ make check && kunittestmodrunner
 * @endcode
 *
 * The kunittestmodrunner application loads all kunittest_*.la modules in the current
 * directory. The exit code of this console application is the number of unexpected failures.
 *
 * If you want the GUI, you should use the kunittestmod script:
 *
 * @code
 * $ make check && kunittestmod
 * @endcode
 *
 * This script starts kunittestguimodrunner application and a helper script to take
 * care of dealing with debug output.
 *
 * @section advanced Advanced usage
 *
 * Normally you just want to use CHECK(). If you are developing some more
 * tests, and they are run (or not) based on some external dependency,
 * you may need to skip some tests. In this case, rather than doing
 * nothing (or worse, writing a test step that aborts the test run), you
 * might want to use SKIP() to record that. Note that this is just a
 * logging / reporting tool, so you just pass in a string:
 *
 * @code
 *     SKIP( "Test skipped because of lack of foo support." );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Similarly, you may have a test step that you know will fail, but you
 * don't want to delete the test step (because it is showing a bug), but
 * equally you can't fix it right now (eg it would break binary
 * compatibility, or would violate a string freeze). In that case, it
 * might help to use XFAIL(), for "expected failure". The test will still
 * be run, and recorded as a failure (assuming it does fail), but will
 * also be recorded separately. Usage might be as follows:
 *
 * @code
 *     XFAIL( 2+1, 4 );
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can mix CHECK(), SKIP() and XFAIL() within a single Tester derived
 * class.
 *
 *
 * @section exceptions Exceptions
 *
 * KUnitTest comes with simple support for testing whether an exception, such as a function call,
 * throws an exception or not. Simply, for the usual macros there corresponding ones for
 * exception testing: CHECK_EXCEPTION, XFAIL_EXCEPTION, and SKIP_EXCEPTION. They all take two
 * arguments: the expression that will catch the exception, and the expression that is supposed
 * to throw the exception.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * CHECK_EXCEPTION(EvilToothFairyException *, myFunction("I forgot to brush my teeth!"));
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The exception is not de-allocated in anyway.
 *
 * The macros does not allow introspection of the exceptions, such as testing a supplied
 * identifier code on the exception object or similar; this requires manual coding, such
 * as custom macros.
 *
 * @section scripts Scripts
 *
 * The library comes with several helper scripts:
 *
 * @li kunittest [app] [dcopobject] : Runs the application app and redirects all debug output to the dcopobject.
 * @li kunittestmod --folder [folder] --query [query] : Loads and runs all modules in the folder matching the query. Use a GUI.
 * @li kunittest_debughelper [dcopobject] : A PERL script that is able to redirect debug output to a RunnerGUI instance.
 *
 * These scripts are part of the kdesdk/kunittest module.
