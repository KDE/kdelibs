- Vertical tabs and titles of dockwidgets are broken
	Vertical tabs are drawn as yellow rectangle (unfilled) without title
	Vertical titles of dockwidgets are not rotated

drawComplexControl:
  CC_SpinBox:
    Needs to honor stepEnabled
    
  CC_ComboBox:
    Interaction with some of the style option flags (frameless, non-editable, etc.) seems missing.
    Frameless implemented via subControlRect, but probably best to honor in draw as well.
    Need to check frame w/designer, at least. Not clear how editable interacts with the SC flags --- 
    might still pass SC_All?

  CC_ScrollBar:
    Fallback to QCommonStyle. Should be OK...

  CC_Slider:
    Looks fine...

  CC_ToolButton:
    Needs to handle the QStyleOptionToolButton::Arrow feature, though perhaps in CE_ToolButtonLabel?

  CC_TitleBar:
    Looks OK

  CC_Q3ListView:
    Looks OK

  CC_GroupBox:
    No handling (Qt 4.1)

    QCommonStyle breaks it up into PE_IndicatorCheckBox, PE_FrameGroupBox, and PE_FrameFocusRect,
    along with drawItem text. Need to check with Oxy folks on what their goals are. Probably need at 
    least a nice placeholder WT for the frame PE, not sure the rest can probably be pushed back to 
    4.1 or 4.0.x

    Also, need to file a Qt docs bug that drawComplexControl docs don't mention QStyleOptionGroupBox for CC_GroupBox
    
  CC_Dial:
    QCommonStyle does something reasonable. No need to style this, I think, it's (thankfully) hardly ever used.

  CC_MdiControls:
    No handling (Qt 4.3)
    Should probably integrate with CC_TitleBar handling somehow, but may need a flag or something to distinguish them, perhaps
    some sort of bevel/bevelless mode in ButtonKOpt? Definitely a lot of overlap..
    Side note: only passes in QStyleOptionComplex
  
drawControl
  CE_PushButton
    QStyleOptionButton::Flat not taken into account (thus the frame is always drawn).

  CE_HeaderSection
    The sort indicator is the same for both ascending and descending directions.

sizeFromContents:
    CT_CheckBox: OK
    CT_ComboBox:
      Missing! Should compute space much like subControlRect computations do

    CT_Q3DockWindow: Missing, along with other Q3DockWindow primitives. Need to test in 
      designer to see if it's drawn OK. 

    CT_HeaderSection: Hardcodes icon size instead of using PM_SmallIconSize.
      Probably should not apply the icon - text margin when there is no icon..

    CT_LineEdit: should probably add it, especially if Oxygen needs it; 
      unfortunately the QLineEdit internals seem to do some pretty weird stuff, 
      hardcoding some margins and anything. But, well, a uniform margin model 
      for this would be nice..
      see also SE_LineEditContents..

    CT_Menu: OK
    
    CT_Q3Header:
      Missing. Probably share code with CT_HeaderSection, or OK as-is?

    CT_MenuBar, CT_MenuItem: CT_MenuBarItem: OK
