/**
 * KDE's trader interface (similar to the CORBA Trader), which provides a way
 * to query the KDE infrastructure for specific applications or components.
 *
 * Basically, KPluginTrader provides a way for an application to query
 * all KDE services (that is, applications, components, plugins) that match
 * a specific set of requirements. This allows to find specific services
 * at run-time without having to hard-code their names and/or paths.
 *
 * For anything relating to mimetypes (type of files), ignore KPluginTrader
 * and use KMimeTypeTrader instead.
 *
 * \par Example
 *
 * If you want to find all plugins for your application,
 * you would define a KMyApp/Plugin servicetype, and then you can query
 * the trader for it:
 * \code
 * KService::List offers =
 *     KPluginTrader::self()->query("KMyApp/Plugin");
 * \endcode
 *
 * You can add a constraint in the "trader query language". For instance:
 * \code
 * KPluginTrader::self()->query("KMyApp/Plugin",
 *                                   "[X-KMyApp-InterfaceVersion] > 15");
 * \endcode
 *
 * Please note that when including property names containing arithmetic operators like - or +, then you have
 * to put brackets around the property name, in order to correctly separate arithmetic operations from
 * the name. So for example a constraint expression like
 * \code
 * X-KMyApp-InterfaceVersion > 4 // wrong!
 * \endcode
 * needs to be written as
 * \code
 * [X-KMyApp-InterfaceVersion] > 4
 * \endcode
 * otherwise it could also be interpreted as
 * Subtract the numeric value of the property "KMyApp" and "InterfaceVersion" from the
 * property "X" and make sure it is greater than 4.\n
 * Instead of the other meaning, make sure that the numeric value of "X-KMyApp-InterfaceVersion" is
 * greater than 4.

     * It will return a list of services that match your
     * specifications.  The only required parameter is the service
     * type.  This is something like 'text/plain' or 'text/html'.  The
     * constraint parameter is used to limit the possible choices
     * returned based on the constraints you give it.
     *
     * The @p constraint language is rather full.  The most common
     * keywords are AND, OR, NOT, IN, and EXIST, all used in an
     * almost spoken-word form.  An example is:
     * \code
     * (Type == 'Service') and (('KParts/ReadOnlyPart' in ServiceTypes) or (exist Exec))
     * \endcode

     * fields found in the .desktop files.
