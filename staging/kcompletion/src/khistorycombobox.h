 * @short A combobox for offering a history and completion
 *
 * A combobox which implements a history like a unix shell. You can navigate
 * through all the items by using the Up or Down arrows (configurable of
 * course). Additionally, weighted completion is available. So you should
 * load and save the completion list to preserve the weighting between
 * sessions.
 *
 * KHistoryComboBox obeys the HISTCONTROL environment variable to determine
 * whether duplicates in the history should be tolerated in
 * addToHistory() or not. During construction of KHistoryComboBox,
 * duplicates will be disabled when HISTCONTROL is set to "ignoredups" or
 * "ignoreboth". Otherwise, duplicates are enabled by default.
