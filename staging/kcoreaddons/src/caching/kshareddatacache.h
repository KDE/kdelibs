 * @brief A simple data cache which uses shared memory to quickly access data

 * This class is meant to be used with KImageCache and similar classes but can

 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @code
 * QString loadTranslatedDocument(KSharedDataCache *cache) {
 *
 *   // Find the data
 *   QByteArray document;
 *
 *   if (!cache->find("translated-doc-template", &document)) {
 *     // Entry is not cached, manually generate and then add to cache.
 *     document = translateDocument(globalTemplate());
 *     cache->insert(document);
 *   }
 *
 *   // Don't forget to encode/decode properly
 *   return QString::fromUtf8(document);
 * }
