<para><acronym>WebDAV</acronym> is a <emphasis>D</emphasis>istributed
<emphasis>A</emphasis>uthoring and <emphasis>V</emphasis>ersioning
protocol for the World Wide Web. It allows for easy management of
documents and scripts on a <ulink
url="help:/kioslave/webdav.html">http</ulink> server, and has
additional features designed to simplify version management amongst
multiple authors.</para>

<para>Usage of this protocol is simple. Type the location you want to
view, similar to a <acronym>http</acronym> URL except for the
webdav:// protocol name at the start. An example is
<userinput>webdav://<replaceable>www.hostname.com/path/</replaceable></userinput>.
If you specify a folder name, a list of files and folders will be
displayed, and you can manipulate these folders and files just as you
would with any other filesystem.</para>

<varlistentry>
<term>Locking</term>
<listitem>
<para>File locking allows users to lock a file, informing others that they 
are
currently working on this file. This way, editing can be done without fear 
that
the changes may be overwritten by another person who is also editing the 
same
document.</para>

<term>Source file access</term>
<listitem>
<para><acronym>WebDAV</acronym> allows access to the script which is called 
to
produce a specific page, so changes can be made to the script itself.</para>

<listitem>

application which supports them. No application currently supports them 
through
this kioslave.</para>
