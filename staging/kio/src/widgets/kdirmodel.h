/**
 * @short A model for a KIO-based directory tree.
 *
 * KDirModel implements the QAbstractItemModel interface (for use with Qt's model/view widgets)
 * around the directory listing for one directory or a tree of directories.
 *
 * Note that there are some cases when using QPersistentModelIndexes from this model will not give
 * expected results. QPersistentIndexes will remain valid and updated if its siblings are added or
 * removed. However, if the QPersistentIndex or one of its ancestors is moved, the QPersistentIndex will become
 * invalid. For example, if a file or directory is renamed after storing a QPersistentModelIndex for it,
 * the index (along with any stored children) will become invalid even though it is still in the model. The reason
 * for this is that moves of files and directories are treated as separate insert and remove actions.
 *
