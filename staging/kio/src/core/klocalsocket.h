 * @class KLocalSocket
 * @brief KLocalSocket allows one to create and use local (Unix) sockets
 *
 * On some platforms, local sockets are a kind of streaming socket
 * that can be used to transmit and receive data just like Internet
 * (TCP) streaming sockets. The difference is that they remain local
 * to the host running them and cannot be accessed externally. They
 * are also very fast and (in theory) consume less resources than
 * standard TCP sockets.
 *
 * KLocalSocket supports two kinds of local socket types (see
 * KLocalSocket::LocalSocketType):
 * - Unix sockets (UnixSocket): standard Unix sockets whose names are
 *   file paths and obey filesystem restrictions
 * - Abstract Unix sockets (AbstractUnixSocket): similar to Unix
 *   sockets, but they don't exist as entries in the filesystem and,
 *   thus, aren't restricted by its permissions
