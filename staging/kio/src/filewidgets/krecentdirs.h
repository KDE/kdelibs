/**
 * The goal of this namespace is to make sure that, when the user needs to 
 * specify a file via the file selection dialog, this dialog will start 
 * in the directory most likely to contain the desired files.
 *
 * This works as follows: Each time the file selection dialog is
 * shown, the programmer can specify a "file-class". The file-dialog will
 * then start with the directory associated with this file-class. When
 * the dialog closes, the directory currently shown in the file-dialog
 * will be associated with the file-class.
 *
 * A file-class can either start with ':' or with '::'. If it starts with
 * a single ':' the file-class is specific to the current application.
 * If the file-class starts with '::' it is global to all applications.
