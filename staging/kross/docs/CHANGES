== Kross CHANGES ==

2.0
* The whole backend got replaced and is build up on Qt's metatypes now.
  This means we are able to throw any QObject/QVariant in and just use
  the slots as script-functions and the properties as script-members.
  So, we don't need wrappers/bindings any longer (and provided
  scripting-interfaces don't need to depend on Kross) on the one hand
  and and earn a more cleaner interface on the other. Beside the try
  to follow KISS, we should earn much more speed that way cause
  everything talks now Qt internal :)
* Port to Qt4 and KDE4
* Improved Python and Ruby backends a lot
* Added KDE JavaScript support using KjsEmbed
* Moved core from koffice/libs to kdelibs
* Moved backends to kdebindings
