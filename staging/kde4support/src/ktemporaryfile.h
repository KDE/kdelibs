 *
 * By default the filename will start with your application's name,
 * followed by six random characters. You can call QTemporaryFile::setFileTemplate()
 * to change that.
 *
 * Porting to QTemporaryFile is simple: in apps, you can probably juse use the default constructor.
 *
 * In parts and plugins, you were probably passing a component data to KTemporaryFile, so instead use:
 * QTemporaryFile(QDir::tempPath() + QLatin1Char('/') + componentData.name() + QLatin1String("XXXXXX"))
 *
 * For setPrefix, change the QDir::tempPath() from the above line.
 * For setSuffix, append it after the XXXXXX.
 *
 * In the simplest case where the application was only calling setSuffix(".txt"), this becomes
 * QTemporaryFile(QDir::tempPath() + QLatin1String("/myapp_XXXXXX.txt"))
