 * \class KTempDir ktempdir.h <KTempDir>
 *
 * @deprecated use QTemporaryDir
 *
 * @brief Create a unique directory for temporary use.
 *
 * The KTempDir class creates a unique directory for temporary use.
 *
 * Porting to QTemporaryDir goes as follows:
 * - Replace KTempDir with QTemporaryDir
 * - Replace name() with path(), but keep in mind that name ended with a '/', while path does not.
 * - Replace status() with isValid()
 *
 * A typical usage of KTempDir was
 *    KTempDir(KStandardDirs::locateLocal("tmp", prefix));
 * This should be ported to
 *    QTemporaryDir(QDir::tempPath() + QLatin1Char('/') + prefix);
 *
 * Note: KTempDir does not create any missing directories, but
 * KStandardDirs::locateLocal() does.
 *
 * @see QTemporaryDir
