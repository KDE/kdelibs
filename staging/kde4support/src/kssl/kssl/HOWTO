NOTE: If you want to add a root file, please contact kde-core-devel and the
maintainer (currently bradh@kde.org) with full details.


1) Build cert_extract
2) Make a directory 'certtmp'
3) cd 'certtmp'
4) Run ../cert_extract /path/to/netscape/cert7.db
   This will create many files and an index
5) Remove the TrustCenter level 0 certificate.
6) Merge these files into a bundle with:
   ../cert_bundle /path/to/netscape/cert7.db cert.index ../caroot/ca-bundle.crt
7) Merge these files into a KDE config file with:
   ../certkde
8) mv ksslcalist ../
9) Merge in the local certs that we added ourselves with:
   cd ..
   ./mergelocal
10) *Do your diffs*!  Make *sure* you commit what you think you are committing.
11) svn commit




To add local files:
1) Create the .pem file and check it into cvs in kdelibs/kio/kssl/kssl.
2) List the pem file name as a single line in 'localcerts'.
