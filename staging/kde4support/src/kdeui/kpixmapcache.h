/**
 * @brief General-purpose pixmap cache for KDE.
 *
 * The pixmap cache can be used to store pixmaps which can later be loaded
 *  from the cache very quickly.
 *
 * Its most common use is storing SVG images which might be expensive to
 *  render every time they are used. With the cache you can render each SVG
 *  only once and later use the stored version unless the SVG file or requested
 *  pixmap size changes.
 *
 * KPixmapCache's API is similar to that of the QPixmapCache so if you're
 *  already using the latter then all you need to do is creating a KPixmapCache
 *  object (unlike QPixmapCache, KPixmapCache doesn't have many static methods)
 *  and calling @ref insert() and @ref find() method on that object:
 *  @code
 *  // Create KPixmapCache object
 *  KPixmapCache* cache = new KPixmapCache("myapp-pixmaps");
 *  // Load a pixmap
 *  QPixmap pix;
 *  if (!cache->find("pixmap-1", pix)) {
 *      // Pixmap isn't in the cache, create it and insert to cache
 *      pix = createPixmapFromData();
 *      cache->insert("pixmap-1", pix);
 *  }
 *  // Use pix
 *  @endcode
 *
 * The above example illustrates that you can also cache pixmaps created from
 *  some data. In case such data is updated, you might need to discard cache
 *  contents using @ref discard() method:
 * @code
 * // Discard the cache if it's too old
 * if (cache->timestamp() < mydataTimestamp()) {
 *     cache->discard();
 * }
 * // Now the cache contains up-to-date data
 * @endcode
 * As demonstrated, you can use cache's @ref timestamp() method to see when
 *  the cache was created. If necessary, you can also change the timestamp
 *  using @ref setTimestamp() method.
 *
 * @deprecated KPixmapCache is susceptible to various non-trivial locking bugs and
 * inefficiencies, and is supported for backward compatibility only (since it exposes
 * a QDataStream API for subclasses). Users should port to KImageCache for a very close
 * work-alike, or KSharedDataCache if they need more control.
 *
