/**
 * @brief Class used to receive notifications about the status of an action execution.
 *
 * The ActionWatcher class provides some signals useful to track the execution of an action.
 * The Action class is designed to be very ligthweight, so it's not the case to make it
 * a QObject subclass. This means the action object can't expose signals. This is the reason
 * why every action (not every Action object) used by the app has an associated ActionWatcher.
 *
 * You don't create watchers directly. Instead, you should get one from the Action::watcher() method,
 * if you have an action object, or with the ActionWatcher::watcher() static method, which takes the
 * action name string.
 *
 * See the documentation of single signals for more details about them.
 *
 * @since 4.4
