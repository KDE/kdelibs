 * state as well.
 *
 * It recognizes two states a key can be in:
 * <ul><li><i>locked</i>: eg. caps-locked (aka toggled)</li>
 *     <li><i>latched</i>: the key is temporarily locked but will be unlocked upon
 *                          the next keypress.</li></ul>
 *
 * An application can either query the states synchronously (@see isKeyLatched,
 * @see isKeyLocked) or connect to KModifierKeyInfo's signals to be notified about
 * changes (@see keyLatched, @see keyLocked).
