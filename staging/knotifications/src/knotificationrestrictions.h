/**
 * KNotificationRestrictions provides a simple mechanism to avoid disruptions
 * during full screen presentations or other use cases where the screensaver or
 * desktop notifcations are inappropriate.
 *
 * Using KNotificationRestrictions is quite straightforward: create an instance
 * of KNotificationRestrictions, passing in the set of or'd flags representing
 * the services that should be prevented from interrupting the user. When done
 * (for instance when the presentation is complete) simply delete the
 * KNotificationRestrictions object.
 *
 * Example: to ensure the screensaver does not turn on during a presentation:
 * @code
 * void MyApp::doPresentation()
 * {
 *   KNotificationRestrictions restrict(KNotificationRestrictions::ScreenSaver);
 *   // show presentation
 * }
 * @endcode
