/**
 * An action for switching between to/from full screen mode. Note that
 * QWidget::isFullScreen() may reflect the new or the old state
 * depending on how the action was triggered (by the application or
 * from the window manager). Also don't try to track the window state
 * yourself. Rely on this action's state (isChecked()) instead.
 *
 * Important: If you need to set/change the fullscreen state manually,
 * use KToggleFullScreenAction::setFullScreen() or a similar function,
 * do not call directly the slot connected to the toggled() signal. The slot
 * still needs to explicitly set the window state though.
 *
 * Note: Do NOT use QWidget::showFullScreen() or QWidget::showNormal().
 * They have several side-effects besides just switching the fullscreen
 * state (for example, showNormal() resets all window states, not just
 * fullscreen). Use the KToggleFullScreenAction::setFullScreen() helper function.
