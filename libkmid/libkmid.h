/**
 * Simple API covering most of the uses of libkmid.
 *
 * You can use the members of this class in pure C applications, just by using
 * the same name as the corresponding function member. 
 * 
 * Suppose you're developing a game and you want to play some background music
 * while the user is playing. You only have to call :
 * 
 * @li kMidInit();
 * @li kMidLoad("RideOfTheValkyries.mid");
 * @li kMidPlay();
 *
 * When the user decides to quit the game, use 
 *
 * @li kMidStop();
 * @li kMidDestruct();
 *
 * to stop the music and release the memory allocated by libkmid.
 *
 * @short A very simple API around the rest of libkmid.
 * @version 0.9.5 17/01/2000
