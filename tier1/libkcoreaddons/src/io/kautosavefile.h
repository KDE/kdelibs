/**
 * \class KAutoSaveFile kautosavefile.h <KAutoSaveFile>
 * 
 * @brief Creates and manages a temporary "auto-save" file.
 * Autosave files are temporary files that applications use to store
 * the unsaved data in a file they have open for
 * editing. KAutoSaveFile allows you to easily create and manage such
 * files, as well as to recover the unsaved data left over by a
 * crashed or otherwise gone process.
 *
 * Each KAutoSaveFile object is associated with one specific file that
 * the application holds open. KAutoSaveFile is also a QObject, so it
 * can be reparented to the actual opened file object, so as to manage
 * the lifetime of the temporary file.
 *
 * Typical use consists of:
 * - verifying whether stale autosave files exist for the opened file
 * - deciding whether to recover the old, autosaved data
 * - if not recovering, creating a KAutoSaveFile object for the opened file
 * - during normal execution of the program, periodically save unsaved
 *   data into the KAutoSaveFile file.
 *
 * KAutoSaveFile holds a lock on the autosave file, so it's safe to
 * delete the file and recreate it later. Because of that, disposing
 * of stale autosave files should be done with releaseLock(). No lock is
 * held on the managed file.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Opening a new file:
 * @code
 *   void Document::open(const KUrl &url)
 *   {
 *       // check whether autosave files exist:
 *       QList<KAutoSaveFile *> staleFiles = KAutoSaveFile::staleFiles(url);
 *       if (!staleFiles.isEmpty()) {
 *           if (KMessageBox::questionYesNo(parent,
 *                                          "Auto-saved files exist. Do you want to recover them now?",
 *                                          "File Recovery",
 *                                          "Recover", "Don't recover") == KMessage::Yes) {
 *               recoverFiles(staleFiles);
 *               return;
 *           } else {
 *               // remove the stale files
 *               foreach (KAutoSaveFile *stale, staleFiles) {
 *                   stale->open(QIODevice::ReadWrite);
 *                   delete stale;
 *               }
 *           }
 *       }
 *
 *       // create new autosave object
 *       m_autosave = new KAutoSaveFile(url, this);
 *
 *       // continue the process of opening file 'url'
 *       ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The function recoverFiles could loop over the list of files and do this:
 * @code
 *   foreach (KAutoSaveFile *stale, staleFiles) {
 *       if (!stale->open(QIODevice::ReadWrite)) {
 *           // show an error message; we could not steal the lockfile
 *           // maybe another application got to the file before us?
 *           delete stale;
 *           continue;
 *       }
 *       Document *doc = new Document;
 *       doc->m_autosave = stale;
 *       stale->setParent(doc); // reparent
 *
 *       doc->setUrl(stale->managedFile());
 *       doc->setContents(stale->readAll());
 *       doc->setState(Document::Modified); // mark it as modified and unsaved
 *
 *       documentManager->addDocument(doc);
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the file is unsaved, periodically write the contents to the save file:
 * @code
 *   if (!m_autosave->isOpen() && !m_autosave->open(QIODevice::ReadWrite)) {
 *       // show error: could not open the autosave file
 *   }
 *   m_autosave->write(contents());
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the user saves the file, the autosaved file is no longer
 * necessary and can be removed or emptied.
 * @code
 *    m_autosave->resize(0);    // leaves the file open
 * @endcode
 *
 * @code
 *    m_autosave->remove();     // closes the file
 * @endcode
