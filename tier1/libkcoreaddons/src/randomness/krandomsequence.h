 * pseudo-random numbers.  This would typically be used in
 * applications like games.
 *
 * In general, you should instantiate a KRandomSequence object and
 * pass along your seed number in the constructor.  From then on,
 * simply call getDouble or getLong to obtain the next
 * number in the sequence.
