 /**
  * @short Class for watching directory and file changes.
  *
  * Watch directories and files for changes.
  * The watched directories or files don't have to exist yet.
  *
  * When a watched directory is changed, i.e. when files therein are
  * created or deleted, KDirWatch will emit the signal dirty().
  *
  * When a watched, but previously not existing directory gets created,
  * KDirWatch will emit the signal created().
  *
  * When a watched directory gets deleted, KDirWatch will emit the
  * signal deleted(). The directory is still watched for new
  * creation.
  *
  * When a watched file is changed, i.e. attributes changed or written
  * to, KDirWatch will emit the signal dirty().
  *
  * Scanning of particular directories or files can be stopped temporarily
  * and restarted. The whole class can be stopped and restarted.
  * Directories and files can be added/removed from the list in any state.
  *
  * The implementation uses the INOTIFY functionality on LINUX.
  * Otherwise the FAM service is used, when available.
  * As a last resort, a regular polling for change of modification times
  * is done; the polling interval is a global config option:
  * DirWatch/PollInterval and DirWatch/NFSPollInterval for NFS mounted
  * directories.
  * The choice of implementation can be adjusted by the user, with the key
  * [DirWatch] PreferredMethod={Fam|Stat|QFSWatch|inotify}
