/**
 *   A class for reading / writing zip archives.
 *
 *   You can use it in QIODevice::ReadOnly or in QIODevice::WriteOnly mode, and it
 *   behaves just as expected.
 *   It can also be used in QIODevice::ReadWrite mode, in this case one can
 *   append files to an existing zip archive. When you append new files, which
 *   are not yet in the zip, it works as expected, i.e. the files are appended at the end.
 *   When you append a file, which is already in the file, the reference to the
 *   old file is dropped and the new one is added to the zip - but the
 *   old data from the file itself is not deleted, it is still in the
 *   zipfile. So when you want to have a small and garbage-free zipfile,
 *   just read the contents of the appended zip file and write it to a new one
 *   in QIODevice::WriteOnly mode. This is especially important when you don't want
 *   to leak information of how intermediate versions of files in the zip
 *   were looking.
 *
 *   For more information on the zip fileformat go to
 *   http://www.pkware.com/products/enterprise/white_papers/appnote.html
