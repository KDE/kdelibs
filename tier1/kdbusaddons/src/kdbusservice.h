/**
 * KDBusService takes care of registering the current process with D-Bus.
 *
 * This registers the application at a predictable location on D-Bus, registers
 * the QCoreApplication (or subclass) object at /MainApplication, and
 * assists in implementing the application side of D-Bus activation from
 * the <a
 * href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html">Desktop
 * Entry Specification</a>.
 *
 * An application can either work in Multiple mode or Unique mode.
 *
 * In Multiple mode, the application can be launched many times.  The service
 * name in the D-Bus registration will contain the PID to distinguish the
 * various instances; for example: <tt>org.kde.konqueror-12345</tt>.
 *
 * In Unique mode, only one instance of this application can ever run.
 * The first instance of the application registers with D-Bus without the PID,
 * and any attempt to run the application again will cause the
 * activateRequested() signal to be emitted in the already-running instance; the
 * duplicate instance will then quit.
 *
 * Unique-mode applications should usually delay parsing command-line arguments
 * until after creating a KDBusService object; that way they know they are the
 * original instance of the application.
 *
 * Applications that set the D-Bus activation entries in their desktop files
 * should use Unique mode and connect to the signals emitted by this class.
 * Note that the D-Bus interface is exported for Multiple-mode applications as
 * well, so it also makes sense for such applications to connect to the signals
 * emitted by this class.
 *
 * @note In order to avoid a race, the application should export its objects to
 * D-Bus before allowing the event loop to run (for example, by calling
 * QCoreApplication::exec()).  Otherwise, the application will appear on the bus
 * before its objects are accessible via D-Bus, which could be a problem for
 * other applications or scripts which start the application in order to talk
 * D-Bus to it immediately.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <code>
     QApplication app(argc, argv);
     app.setApplicationName("kuiserver");
     app.setOrganizationDomain("kde.org");
     // Create your dbus objects here
     // ...
     KDBusService service(KDBusService::Unique);
     return app.exec();
 * </code>
 *
 * @since 5.0
