/**
 * @short A class for serializing access to a resource that is shared between multiple processes.
 *
 * This class can be used to serialize access to a resource between
 * multiple processes. Instead of using lock files, which could
 * become stale easily, the registration of dummy dbus services is used
 * to allow only one process at a time to access the resource.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * KDBusInterProcessLock *lock = new KDBusInterProcessLock("myresource");
 * connect(lock, SIGNAL(lockGranted(KDBusInterProcessLock *)),
 *               this, SLOT(doCriticalTask(KDBusInterProcessLock *)));
 * lock->lock();
 *
 * ...
 *
 * ... ::doCriticalTask(KDBusInterProcessLock *lock)
 * {
 *    // change common resource
 *
 *    lock->unlock();
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
