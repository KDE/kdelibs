 * @short Encapsulates a data set to be plotted in a KPlotWidget.
 *
 * Think of a KPlotObject as a set of data displayed as a group in the plot.
 * Each KPlotObject consists of a list of KPlotPoints, a "type" controlling 
 * how the data points are displayed (some combination of Points, Lines, or
 * Bars), a color, and a size. There is also a parameter which controls the
 * shape of the points used to display the KPlotObject.
 *
 * @note KPlotObject will take care of the points added to it, so when clearing
 * the points list (eg with clearPoints()) any previous reference to a KPlotPoint
 * already added to a KPlotObject will be invalid.
