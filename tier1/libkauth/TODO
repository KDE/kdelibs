Todo list for libkauth:
- Add cmake macros
- Add vendor name and icon to actions.ini
- Add an option (either on build-time or at invocation time) to enable/disable the helper quit timeout.
  This is useful for debugging.
- Check with others on k-c-d if it's needed to add strings with error descriptions.
- Stop requests must be action-specific instead of global
