/**
 * @short A drop-in replacement for QLabel that displays hyperlinks.
 *
 * KUrlLabel is a drop-in replacement for QLabel that handles text
 * in a fashion similar to how an HTML widget handles hyperlinks.  The
 * text can be underlined (or not) and set to different colors.  It
 * can also "glow" (cycle colors) when the mouse passes over it.
 *
 * KUrlLabel also provides signals for several events, including
 * the mouse leaving and entering the text area and all forms of
 * mouse clicking.
 *
 * By default KUrlLabel accepts focus. When focused, standard
 * focus rectangle is displayed as in HTML widget.
 * Pressing Enter key accepts the focused label.
 *
 * A typical usage would be something like so:
 *
 * \code
 * KUrlLabel *address = new KUrlLabel(this);
 * address->setText("My homepage");
 * address->setUrl("http://www.home.com/~me");
 * connect(address, SIGNAL(leftClickedUrl(const QString&)),
 *                  SLOT(processMyUrl(const QString&)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * In this example, the text "My homepage" would be displayed
 * as blue, underlined text.  When the mouse passed over it,
 * it would "glow" red.  When the user clicks on the text, the
 * signal leftClickedUrl() would be emitted with "http://www.home.com/~me"
 * as its argument.
