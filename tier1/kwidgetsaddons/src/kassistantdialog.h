/**
 * This class provides a framework for assistant dialogs.
 *
 * The use of this class is the same as KWizard in KDE3.
 * You should use the word "assistant" instead of "wizard" both in the source 
 * and translatable strings.
 *
 * An assistant dialog consists of a sequence of pages.
 * Its purpose is to guide the user (assist) through a process step by step.
 * Assistant dialogs are useful for complex or infrequently occurring tasks 
 * that people may find difficult to learn or do.
 * Sometimes a task requires too many input fields to fit them on a single dialog.
 *
 * KAssistantDialog provides page titles and displays Next, Back, Finish, Cancel, 
 * and Help push buttons, as appropriate to the current position in the page sequence.
 * The Finish Button has the code KDialog::User1, The Next button is KDialog::User2 
 * and the Back button is KDialog::User3.
 * The help button may be hidden using showButton(KDialog::Help, false)
 *
 * Create and populate dialog pages that inherit from QWidget and add them 
 * to the assistant dialog using addPage().
 *
 * The functions next() and back() are virtual and may be reimplemented to
 * override the default actions of the next and back buttons.
