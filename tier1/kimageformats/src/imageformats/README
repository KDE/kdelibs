This directory contains Qt imageformat plugins. See QImageIOPlugin docs
for how to write a new handler.

It also contains desktop files for the plugins that come with Qt.

The TGA plugin supports more formats than Qt's own TGA plugin;
specifically, the one provided here supports indexed, greyscale and RLE
images (types 1-3 and 9-11), while Qt's plugin only supports type 2
(RGB) files.
