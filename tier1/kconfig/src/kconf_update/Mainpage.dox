/** @mainpage ./kconf_update

kconf_update is a tool designed to update config files. Over time applications
sometimes need to rearrange the way configuration options are stored. Since
such an update shouldn't influence the configuration options that the user
has selected, the application must take care that the options stored in the
old way will still be honored.

What used to happen is that the application looks up both the old and the
new configuration option and then decides which one to use. This method has 
several drawbacks:
- The application may need to read more configuration files than strictly
  needed, resulting in a slower startup.
- The application becomes bigger with code that will only be used once.

kconf_update addresses these problems by offering a framework to update 
configuration files without adding code to the application itself.
