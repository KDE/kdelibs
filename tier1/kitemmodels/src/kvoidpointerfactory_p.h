/**
 * @brief A Class for managing void pointers for use in QModelIndexes.
 *
 * This class creates void pointers pointing to individual blocks of memory.
 * The pointed-to memory contains zeros.
 *
 * Memory is allocated in blocks of size @p blockSize times sizeof(void*) at a time. The used
 * memory is automatically freed and can be cleared manually.
 *
 * The void pointers should not be dereferenced, but only used as a unique
 * identifier suitable for use with createIndex() and for comparison with other void pointers.
