/** @brief A Job is a simple abstraction of an action that is to be executed in a thread context.
 *
 * It is essential for the ThreadWeaver library that as a kind of convention, the different creators of Job objects do not touch
 * the protected data members of the Job until somehow notified by the Job.
 *
 * Jobs may not be executed twice. Create two different objects to perform two consecutive or parallel runs.
 * (Note: this rule is being reconsidered.)
 *
 * Jobs may declare dependencies. If Job B depends on Job A, B may not be executed before A is finished. To learn about
 * dependencies, see DependencyPolicy.
 *
 * Job objects do not inherit QObject. To connect to signals when jobs are started or finished, see QObjectDecorator.
