/** WeaverInterface provides a common interface for weaver implementations.

In most cases, it is sufficient for an application to hold exactly one
ThreadWeaver job queue. To execute jobs in a specific order, use job
dependencies. To limit the number of jobs of a certain type that can
be executed at the same time, use resource restrictions. To handle
special requirements of the application when it comes to the order of
execution of jobs, implement a special queue policy and apply it to
the jobs.

Users of the ThreadWeaver API are encouraged to program to this
interface, instead of the implementation. This way, implementation
changes will not affect user programs.

This interface can be used for example to implement adapters and
decorators. The member documentation is provided in the Weaver and
WeaverImpl classes.
