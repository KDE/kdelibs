    /** Observers provides signals on some Weaver events that are
        otherwise only available through objects of different classes
        (threads, jobs). Usually, access to the signals of those objects
        is not provided through the ThreadWeaver API. Use an observer to receive
        notice, for example, on thread activity.

        Observers are registered through the WeaverInterface API
        (see WeaverInterface::registerObserver).

        To unregister, simply delete the observer.

        Observers are meant to be used within the controlling thread (usually
        the main thread), that creates the Jobs. If this is not the case, be
        aware not to delete Job objects externally that you reference in a
        WeaverObserver implementation.
