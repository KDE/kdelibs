/** @brief QueuePolicy is an interface for customizations of the queueing behaviour of jobs.
 *
 *  A job can have a number of queue policies assigned. In that case, the job is only
 *  executed when the method canRun() of all assigned policies return true. For every call to
 *  canRun() that returns true, it is guaranteed that the method free() or the method release()
 *  is called. Calling free() means the job has been executed, while calling release() means
 *  the job was not executed for external reasons, and will be tried later on.
 *
 *  As an example, dependencies can be implemented using a QueuePolicy: canRun() returns true
 *  when the job has no unresolved dependencies. free() and release() are empty.
 *
 *  A job can have multiple queue policies assigned, and will only be executed if all of them
 *  return true from canRun() within the same execution attempt. Jobs only keep a reference to the
 *  QueuePolicy. Therefore, the same policy object can be assigned to multiple jobs and this way
 *  control the way all those jobs are exeuted. Jobs never assume ownership of their assigned queue
 *  policies.
