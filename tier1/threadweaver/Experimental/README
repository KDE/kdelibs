This directory contains code that is supposed to be tested an commented on
before it may eventually be added to the ThreadWeaver API. Also, it will not
be installed by default. 

It also contains classes that may be generically useful, but will become part
of the ThreadWeaver library (like specialized Job classes). 

Comments are welcome.
