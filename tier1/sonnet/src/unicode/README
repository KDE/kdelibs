parseucd parses the unicode data file.

It takes a datafile as stdin and output a serialized version of the data to a QMultiMap in stdout for later use.

CMake needs process the relevent UCD files for inclusion in the word and sentence boundry checker
something like:
./parseucd < ../data/GraphemeBreakProperty.txt > gb.map
./parseucd < ../data/SentenceBreakProperty.txt > sb.map
./parseucd < ../data/WordBreakProperty.txt > wb.map
