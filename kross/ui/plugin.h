 *     <collection name="file" text="File">
 *         <script name="dummy_script" text="Dummy Script" comment="Dummy Script example"
 *                 file="dummy_script.py" interpreter="python" />
 *     </collection>
 * </KrossScripting>
 * \endcode
 *
 * The 'name' attribute in collection element will be used to match the menu object name.
 * If no menu already exists with this name, a new one is created. In this example, the user will
 * see a menu item with the text "Dummy Script" in "File" menu, which will execute the dummy_script.py script.
 *
 * By default it tries to find kross rc files in %APPDATA%/scripts directory.
 * Clients of this class can use slotEditScriptActions() as a way to override and/or extend the
 * default script actions (if they exist at all).
 *
 * You may create multiple instances of ScriptingPlugin by using alternative c'tor.
