/**
 * KNotification is used to notify the user of an event.
 * 
 * \section introduction
 *
 * There are two main kinds of notifications:
 *
 * @li Feedback events:
 * For notifying the user that he/she just performed an operation, like maximizing a
 * window. This allows us to play sounds when a dialog appears.
 * This is an instant notification.  It ends automatically after a small timeout.
 *
 * @li persistant notifications:
 * Notify when the user received a new message, or when something else important happened
 * the user has to know about.  This notification has a start and a end.  It begins when
 * the event actually occurs, and finishes when the message is acknowledged or read.
 *
 * Example of a persistent notification in an instant messaging application:
 * The application emits the notification when the message is actually received, and closes it only
 * when the user has read the message (when the message window has received the focus) using the close() slot
 * Persistent notifications must have the Persistent flag.
 *
 * By default a notification will use the application name as title, but you
 * can also provide a brief text in the title and a more precise description in
 * the body text.  This is especially useful for notifications coming from
 * applications which should be considered "part of the system", like a battery
 * monitor or a network connection manager.
 * For example a battery indicator could use "Low Battery" as a title and "Only
 * 12 minutes left." as a body text.
 *
 * In order to perform a notification, you need to create a description file, which contains
 * default parameters of the notification, and use KNotification::event at the place in the
 * application code where the notification occurs.
 * The returned KNotification pointer may be used to connect signals or slots
 *
 * \section file The global config file
 * Your application should install a file called:
 *  <em>$KDEDIR/share/apps/appname/appname.notifyrc</em>
 *
 * You can do this with the following CMake command:
 * install( FILES appname.notifyrc  DESTINATION ${DATA_INSTALL_DIR}/appname))
 *
 *  This file contains  mainly 3 parts
 *   <ol><li>\ref global "Global information"</li>
 *       <li>\ref context "Context information"</li>
 *       <li>\ref events "Definition of individual events"</li></ol>
 *
 *  \subsection global Global information
 * The global part looks like that
 * <pre>
		   [Global]
		   IconName=Filename
		   Comment=Friendly Name of app
		   Name=Name of app
 * </pre>
 *   The icon filename is just the name, without extension,  it's found with the KIconLoader.
 *   The Comment field will be used in KControl to describe the application.
 *   The Name field is optional and may be used as the application name for popup,
 *   if Name is not present, Comment is used instead
 * 
 * \subsection context Context information
 * 
 * This part consists of hints for the configuration widget
 *  <pre>
		   [Context/group]
		   Name=Group name
		   Comment=The name of the group for contacts

		   [Context/folder]
		   Name=Group name
 *  </pre>
 *  The second part of the groupname is the context identifier.
 *  It should not contain special characters.
 *  The Name field is the one the user will see (and which is translated)
 *
 * \subsection events Definition of Events
 *
 * The definition of the events forms the most important part of the config file
 * <pre>
		   [Event/newmail]
		   Name=New email
		   Comment=You have got a new email
		   Contexts=folder,group
		   Action=Sound|Popup

		   [Event/contactOnline]
		   Name=Contact goes online
		   Comment=One of your contact has been connected
		   Contexts=group
		   Sound=filetoplay.ogg
		   Action=None
 *  </pre>
 *  These are the default settings for each notifiable event.
 *  Action is the string representing the action. Actions can be added to
 *  the KNotify daemon as plugins, by deriving from KNotifyPlugin.
 *  At the time of writing, the following actions are available: Taskbar,
 *  Sound, Popup, Logfile, KTTS, Execute.
 *  Actions can be combined by seperating them with '|'.
 *
 *  Contexts is a comma separated list of possible context for this event.
 *
 *  \section userfile The user's config file
 *
 *  This is an implementation detail, and is described here for your information.
 *
 *  In the config file, there are two parts:  the event configuration, and the context information
 * \subsection context Context information
 *  These are hints for the configuration dialog. They contain both the internal id of the context, and the user visible string.
 *  <pre>
		   [Context/group]
		   Values=1:Friends,2:Work,3:Family
 *  </pre>
 * \subsection event Events configuration
 *   This contains the configuration of events for the user.
 *   It contains the same fields as the description file.
 *    The key of groups is in the form 
 *  <em>Event/&lt;EventName&gt;/&lt;ContextName&gt;/&lt;ContextValue&gt;</em>
 * <pre>
		   [Event/contactOnline]
		   Action=Sound
		   Sound=/usr/share/sounds/super.ogg

		   [Event/contactOnline/group/1]
		   Action=Popup|Sound
 * </pre>
 * 
 * \section example Example of code
 * 
 * This portion of code will fire the event for the "contactOnline" event
 * 
 * @code
	KNotification *notification= new KNotification ( "contactOnline", widget );
	notification->setText( i18n("The contact <i>%1</i> has gone online", contact->name() );
	notification->setPixmap( contact->pixmap() );
	notification->setActions( QStringList( i18n( "Open chat" ) ) );
	
	foreach( const QString &group , contact->groups() ) {
		notification->addContext( "group" , group ) ;
	}
	
	connect(notification, SIGNAL(activated(unsigned int )), contact , SLOT(slotOpenChat()) );
	
	notification->sendEvent();
 * @endcode
