- VideoWidget::setFullScreen will make the real VideoWidget inaccessible for the application as the
  backend widget is reparented to an internal widget. This internal widget is shown in fullscreen
  mode. But this way all events that happen on the (fullscreen) video widget don't arrive at the
  application. Forwarding events still doesn't solve the problem of mapping mouse coordinates or
  adding custom widgets (like a toolbar). Though perhaps adding those widgets as overlay is even
  better. :)

- let the Phonon KCM check whether the hw: ALSA device already does mixing, only if it does not
   prefer the dmix: device

- add Player dbus interface in MediaObject

- add global setting to pause video when it's not visible

- add a way to request a specific version (>=) from the Backend, so that known to be buggy Backends aren't used

- menu support? DVD media and Matroska files can come with a menu/control track.
  Is any special API needed for that or does clicking on the video suffice?

- Subtitles

- Video Overlays (OSD) like: show a rectangle as a play symbol, show the position in
  the file as something like [IIIIIIIII------], and so on

- don't crash:
  - when no backend is available
  - when an iface object isn't available

- consider whether to add a signal to notify when the information for
  availableAudioStreams/availableVideoStreams/availableSubtitleStreams
  is available

look at pavucontrol, gsmartmix
