<b>Does KDE support my soundcard for audio output?</b>
<p>
   KDE uses aRts to play sounds. aRts bases on your normal Linux sound drivers,
   either OSS or ALSA (using the OSS emulation). So if your soundcard is
   supported by either ALSA or OSS (i.e. any other Linux app can output sound),
   it will work.
<p>
<b>Is there sound support if I am not using Linux?</b>
<p>
   Only if there are OSS (compatible) drivers for your platform (i.e. FreeBSD).
   Feel free to contribute. Simply rewrite audiosubsys.cc in kdelibs/arts/flow.
<p>
<b>I can't play wav files with artsd?</b>
<p>
   Check that artsd is linked to libaudiofile (ldd artsd), if it isn't,
   download kdesupport, recompile everything and it will work.
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr bgcolor="#fafacb"><h2>non-aRts applications</h2></tr></table>
<p>
<b>As soon as KDE is running, no other application can access my sound device?</b>
<p>
   Yes, since the aRts sound server KDE uses is running, it is using the
   sound device. If it is idle for 60 seconds, it will release it
   automatically (auto-suspend).
<p>
<b>You said it suspends after 60 seconds, it doesn't for me?</b>
<p>
   Currently it doesn't suspend when using full duplex. Turn full duplex off
   and it will suspend. Turning it off is a good idea anyway if you only use
   aRts for playing things.
<p>
<b>What should I do to run old, non-aRts applications?</b>
<p>
   Start them with artsdsp. For instance, if you normally would run
<p>
     mpg123 foo.mp3
<p>
   use
<p>
     artsdsp mpg123 foo.mp3
<p>
   now - this will redirect the sound output to aRts. As you see this method
   doesn't require changing existing apps. It is a bit hacky however, and
   does not yet fully support all features of the soundcard right now, so
   some apps might not work.
<p>
<b>Are there theoretical limits which apps will never work with artsdsp?</b>
<p>
   No. Of course artsdsp will have a little more latency and a little more
   CPU usage. Other than that, consider every app that doesn't work with
   artsdsp a bug in artsdsp. Basically the way artsdsp works should, if
   implemented properly, make EVERY app work with it (including stuff
   like quake3).
<p>
<b>What do I do if an app doesn't work with artsdsp?</b>
<p>
   Of course you can wait for artsd to suspend. Other than that, there is
   currently no peaceful support for pausing artsd. A brutal but working
   way to get rid of it is
<p>
     killall artsd ; killall artswrapper
<p>
     &lt;start app here&gt;
<p>
     kcminit arts
<p>
   Some aRts apps might crash, though, once you killed the server. Maybe
   there will be a better way in the future, feel free to write one yourself
   if you like.
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr bgcolor="#fafacb"><h2>latency</h2></tr></table>
<p>
<b>I sometimes get short pauses when listening to music, is this a bug?</b>
<p>
   This is no bug in aRts unfortunately, most likely your problem is
   caused since the linux kernel is not really good at realtime scheduling.
   There are situations where aRts will not be able to keep up with playback.
   You can however enable realtime rights (via KControl), and use a large
   latency setting (like 250ms or don't care), which should make it better.
<p>
<b>Whats the effect of the response time setting anyway?</b>
<p>
   A lower value means that aRts will take <b>less time to respond</b> to
   external events (i.e. time time that it takes between closing a window and
   hearing a sound played by artsd), will use <b>more cpu</b>, and <b>more
   likely cause dropouts</b>.
<p>
   The help text (in kcontrol) is irritating.
<p>
<b>Why is artsd taking that much CPU time?</b>
<p>
   Check your response time settings. On the other hand, the KDE2.0 version
   is not yet really optimized. This will improve, and until then no real
   prediction can be made how fast artsd can or can't be.
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr bgcolor="#fafacb"><h2>network transparency</h2></tr></table>
<p>
<b>What do I need for network transparency?</b>
<p>
   Enable it in kcontrol (enable X11 server for security information and
   network transparency). Then go and copy your .mcoprc to all machines
   you plan to use network transparency from. Relogin. Make sure that
   the hosts that interact know each other by name (i.e. make sure that
   they have resolvable names or are in /etc/hosts).
<p>
<b>Can I debug it if it doesn't work?</b>
<p>
   Yes, if you have the source. go to kdelibs/arts/examples, make check
   there, then run
<p>
     referenceinfo global:Arts_SimpleSoundServer
<p>
   there you'll see what hostname and port aRts. For instance tcp:orion:1698
   would mean that any client trying to use artsd network transparent should
   know how to reach "orion".
