- fix random segfaults on solaris

aRts-0.5.3:

- threading support (libmcop_mt)
- glib-2.0 mainloop integration (libgmcop)
- KArtsWidget makes it easy to use Arts::Widget implementations in conjunction
  with qt widgets (i.e. no extra window), this also removes the annoying extra
  window in artscontrol
- generic gui factory used by noatun and artscontrol to create effect guis

================================================================================
This file starts in the middle of nowhere, because it hasn't always been
here. But please update this if you do bigger changes (fixing a spelling
error in a comment probably doesn't count, doing one of the TODO items
most certainly does).
