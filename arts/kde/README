libartskde Introduction
-----------------------

1. What is libartskde?
libartskde is a simple KDE->aRts wrapper
that allows the developer to use KDE
technology to access aRts.
ie. no need to deal with std::string's anymore
etc.. you can just use QString's or KURL's
to play sound

2. How to use it?
<snip>
1	Arts::Dispatcher dispatcher;
2	Arts::SoundServerV2 server;
3	server = Arts::Reference("global:Arts_SoundServerV2");

4	KURL file = "file:/home/nikoz/test.mp3";

5	KPlayObjectFactory factory(d->server);
6	KPlayObject *playobj = factory.createPlayObject(file, true);

7	playobj->play();
<snap>

Line:
1	Sets up the a new Arts::Dispatcher
2-3	Starts a new SimpleSoundServer in the running artsd process

4	Simple test URL to demonstrate the use with KURL

5	Creates a KPlayObjectFactory, parameter: our SoundServerV2
6	Gets a KPlayObject from the factory, containing an Arts::PlayObject
        created in our running artsd process
	First Parameter: KURL url (specifies the url to be played)
			 bool createBUS (specifies wheter to create a Synth_BUS_UPLINK or not,
					 "false" is only interesting if you want to use EffectsStacks
					 etc..., see Noatun)
7	Play the file

That's it, with 7 LOC a "full" media player :)

Enjoy...
