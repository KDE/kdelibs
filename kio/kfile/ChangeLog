Sat Feb 26 00:26:55 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kdiroperator.cpp:
	lottsa changes, e.g. action handling more clear now.
	fixed completed item not clearning the previous selection

	* kfileviewitem.cpp:
	fixed unreadable pixmap not shown, when files were deleted

	* kfiledialog.cpp (selectedURLs): 
	re-enabled the hack to support multi-selection, until we have something
	better

	* kcombiview.*:
	forward the sorting to the right view (or should it apply to the dir-
	view as well?) Sort of broken tho.

Sun Feb 20 01:50:44 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kdiroperator.*, kfiledialog.* (saveConfig): 
	implemented loading, saving and applying configuration

	* kfiledialog.cpp (setURL): 
	KDirComboBox is now a combo for recent directories as well as the
	root-dir, home-dir and Desktop-dir.
	Recent dirs will be saved in kdeglobals.

Fri Feb 18 23:35:04 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfilefilter.cpp (eventFilter): 
	intercept Key_Return and Key_Enter in the filter-combo and emit
	filterChanged instead of letting the dialog close

Thu Feb 17 19:09:54 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledialog.{cpp,h} (KDirComboBox): 
	Added KDirComboBox and replaced the directory combobox with it. It
	even does something now :) Items need to be indented tho.

	* kfilereader.cpp, kdiroperator.{cpp,h}: 
	fixed showHidden default

Tue Feb 15 14:21:41 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfile.h (class KFile): 
	added a small class that contains all the enums now.
	cleaned up the enums (hope not too many apps will be broken)
	added flags for "Existing files only" and "local files only"

	* all views (setSelected()):
	replaced highlightItem(item) with setSelected(item, bool) which makes
	it more suitable and more consistent with Qt.
	added selectionChanged() method (necessary for multiselection)

	* kfileview.*:
	added invertSelection()

	* kfiledialog.cpp:
	made it work with multiselection
	added static methods for multiselection
	added getOpenURL(), getOpenURLs and getSaveURL()
	
	* kdiroperator.cpp (setSorting): 
	added setSorting() and sorting() to keep sorting when switching views
	a few cosmetic and KAction changes

Sun Feb 13 00:45:12 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledialog.cpp (completion): 
	small fix: completion and auto-directory following works also
	without protocol-part in the location.

Sat Feb 12 15:30:40 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileview.h:
	made setSorting() and sortReversed() virtual so that subclasses
	can intercept that to show sorting order
	
	* kfiledetailview.cpp,h (setSortIndicator): 
	enable header-clicking again to set the sorting

Fri Feb 11 12:17:59 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledialog.cpp (KFileDialog): 
	fixed filefilter not being applied in constructor

Thu Feb 10 17:06:36 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kdiroperator.cpp (connectView): 
	- Now that KToggleAction is fixed, I can commit the new stuff:
	  Offer Actions for all the common functionality, i.e. sorting, setting
	  the view, home(), cdUp(), back, forward, etc.
	  All actions are exposed through a QActionCollection

	  BTW, I'd really like to have a way to change the state of an action
	  without it calling the associated slot. For now I use blockSignals()
	  (thanks, Simon), but this sucks.
	
	- renamed fileList to fileView (that was an old relic of KDE 1)

	* kfiledialog.*:
	- make use of the new Actions and fill the toolbar again (up, back, 
	  forward, reload, home).

	- the combo in the toolbar is going to change, it does nothing now
	  (only shows the Root and Desktop dirs with a nice icon).

Thu Feb 10 12:59:29 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kdiroperator.cpp (insertNewFiles): 
	aahhh, finally fixed that infinite loop in KFileView::mergeLists
	clear the view before calling view->addItemList( currentContents );

	* kfilereader.cpp (setURL): 
	don't disable dirWatch update (setAutoUpdate) when setting a remote URL

Fri Feb  4 12:42:37 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledetailview.cpp (insertItem): 
	- don't let QListView sort the items
	  I disabled clicking at the headers for now, will fix that later
	- don't flicker on mimetype-pixmap update

Thu Feb  3 12:15:16 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileview.h + all views where necessary
	added selectAll()
	added isSelected( const KFileViewItem * )
	added const KFileViewItemList * selectedItems()
	added const KFileViewItemList * items()

	spiced up documentation of KFileView a bit

Sun Jan 30 22:20:14 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileviewitem.cpp (pixmap): 
	fixed some issues for different pixmap sizes

	* kfileiconview.{h,cpp} (setPixmapSize):
	added configurability for different pixmap sizes

Sun Jan 30 16:49:12 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileview.h + all views:
	A view can now have a name (setViewName() and viewName())
	This is useful to differentiate views and to display the names in a
	popupmenu for switching between views.

Sun Jan 30 12:41:04 2000  Werner Trobin  <wtrobin@carinthia.com>
	The preview mode works again. It's very similar to the Qt-2.1 QFD
	preview mode - but it's not totally the same. There are some rough
	edges which have to be ironed out, but it works :)
	For further information, see kfilepreview.*
	Note: kpreview and so on are obsolete (IMHO)
	
Sat Jan 29 15:33:37 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	Time to add some changelogs again, all the recent hard work of the 
	restructuring is only in CVS-log...

	* kfileview.cpp (compareItems): 
	- added support to disable sorting directories first (QDir::DirsFirst)
	- added support to sort by date and to sort reversed
	- removed unused findCompletion method
	- sort case insensitive by default
	- some optimization for mergeList
	- fixed infinite loop in mergeLists, when the lists are the same
	  (I think another one is still there, but I'm tired now)
	- changed setSortMode stuff: Switching-mode replaced with 
	  sortReversed(). The enum Switching will be removed, soon.
	- made setSortMode public

	* kfileviewitem.cpp:
	- added time_t mTime() to enable sorting by modification time
	
	* kdiroperator.cpp:
	- offer sorting options in popupmenu
	- use checkAccess before creating directories. I guess this will again
	  change when the new kio will be used, tho. 
	- show progress widget at the bottom (otherwise the header of e.g.
	  the detail-view would be covered).
	- Added LGPL copyright header
	
	* kfilewidget.cpp (connectSignals):
	- connect to all signals of KDirOperator
	- directly connect SIGNAL to SIGNAL -> removed slotFileHighlighted etc.
	- fixed some sorting/merging bugs

	* {kfiledialog,kdiroperator}.{cpp,h};
	- support for disabling chdir (some apps may not want KFileDialog /
	  KFileReader change the working directory under their feet)
	- Added LGPL header in cpp-file

	* kfilereader.cpp (stat):
	- fixed: some special files were recognized as directories

	* kfstest.cpp:
	- added test for KFileWidget (widget -> KFileWidget, 
	  diroperator -> KDirOperator)
	
Sun Oct 31 00:56:23 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileinfo.cpp (readUserInfo): Don't call getpwnam() and getgrgid()
	all the time over and over again! This opens and parses /etc/passwd
	or /etc/group with every call!
	Now we load /etc/passwd and /etc/group once and store the interesting 
	stuff in static QMaps, which need to be freed with KFileInfo::cleanup()
	cleanup() is called from KFileBaseDialog's destructor.
	
	This speeds up KFileDialog a LOT!

Sat Oct 23 01:55:00 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledetaillist.cpp (key): hopefully implemented correct mapping
	from KFileInfo to QListViewItem and back. I had a hard time convincing
	QListView that KFileInfoContents knows best where to insert an item
	Now the detaillist is even usable :)
	Fixed a problem with selection and highlighting
	Disable clicking on listview headers that can't be used for sorting

	* kfileinfocontents.cpp (setSorting): call insertItem() with a correct
	(is it?) index, instead of -1

Thu Oct 21 23:18:54 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfiledialog.cpp (init): removed "[development only] from tooltip
	(sorry to break the translations, but this HAD to go)

	* don't update anything when leaving the configure-dialog with Cancel

Wed Oct 20 15:07:16 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfileinfo.cpp,h: implemented KFileInfo::filePath() and fixed 
	KFileInfo::absURL() not being set in some cases
	
	* kdir.cpp: fixed a buglet in the path (double slashes)

	* kfiledetaillist.cpp (KFileDetailList): improved selecting files
	(single click, double click, Return-key)
	but the mapping from QListViewItem to KFileInfo is still quite broken
	
1999-06-09  Woohyun JANG <louis@mizi.co.kr>

	* kdir.cpp: used QString::toLocal8Bit() instead of QString::ascii() 
	for file names and directory names.

	* kfiledialog.cpp: used QStringList instead of QStrIList. 

1999-01-14  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* kfiledialog.cpp: fixed some GUI problems and moved all default
	configurations into config-kfile.h. 
	Changed some default values, so that users that never looked into
	the config dialog gets a nice suprise with 1.1 ;-)

	* kfiledialog.cpp: changed selectedFile to return decoded path instead
	of encoded one

Thu Jan  7 23:14:39 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfilebookmark.cpp: renamed class KBookmark to KFileBookmark to 
	avoid problems with KFM's KBookmark class. Renamed bookmark.* to
	kfilebookmark.*, too and changed all occurrences of bookmark.* to
	kfilebookmark.* (especially all the .po-files)

Wed Dec  2 15:59:13 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfilesimpleview.cpp: Fixed some more keyboard navigation bugs.
	Added method isColCompletelyVisible( int col ), now you can scroll
	perfectly to make items completely visible.
	Moreover, in resizeEvent() the number of columns was not calculated 
	correctly in a special case.
	And the currently selected item is rehighlighted correctly after
	resizing, now.

1998-10-12  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* kfiledialog.cpp (okPressed): Changed okPressed to store the correct
	filename before leaving the dialog.

	* kfileinfolistwidget.cpp: added focus handling

	* kfileinfolistwidget.cpp: added keyevent handling to handle

Mon Mar 16 11:36:07 1998 Daniel Grana <grana@ie.iwi.unibe.ch>
	* added create directory, pops up a modal dialog, should add

Thu Mar 12 09:32:06 1998  Daniel Grana <grana@ie.iwi.unibe.ch>
	* worked on the dir and file completion, should do both now,
	text in the location box will be added as much as possible
	(right now it's the lowest denominator of dir&file&location-text)
	* added sorting for the detailed list, so far only name and size
	sorting implemented
	* added single click selection for directories

	between getOpenFileName and getOpenFileURL

Sun Feb 15 23:13:47 1998 Richard Moore <rich@kde.org>
	
	* More work on the bookmarks - they should work properly now, you
	must create the directory ~/.kde/share/apps/kdeui to store the
	bookmarks in.
	
	* Regenerated docs

Thu Feb 12 17:27:51 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>
