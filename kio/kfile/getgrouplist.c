   getgrouplist() taken from the FreeBSD libc. The copyright notice
   in the file /usr/src/lib/libc/gen/getgrouplist.c on FreeBSD is out
   of date, as it has incorrect copyright years and still names the
   4-clause BSD license -- however, the Regents of the University of
   California at Berkeley have declared that clause 3 is void; only
   clauses 1,2 and 4 apply. See the full license text below.
