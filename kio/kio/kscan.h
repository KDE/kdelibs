/**
 * This is a base class for scanning dialogs. You can derive from this class
 * and implement your own dialog. An implementation is available in
 * kdegraphics/libkscan.
 *
 * Application developers that wish to add scanning support to their program
 * can use the static method @p KScanDialog::getScanDialog() to get an instance
 * of the user's preferred scanning dialog.
 *
 * Typical usage looks like this (e.g. in a slotShowScanDialog() method):
 *
 * <pre>
 * if ( !m_scanDialog ) {
 *     m_scanDialog = KScanDialog::getScanDialog( this, "scandialog" );
 *     if ( !m_scanDialog ) // no scanning support installed?
 *         return;
 *
 *     connect( m_scanDialog, SIGNAL( finalImage( const QImage&, int )),
 *              SLOT( slotScanned( const QImage&, int ) ));
 * }
 *
 * if ( m_scanDialog->setup() ) // only if scanner configured/available
 *     m_scanDialog->show();
 * </pre>
 *
 * This will create and show a non-modal scanning dialog. Connect to more
 * signals if you like.
 *
 * If you implement an own scan-dialog, you also have to implement a
 * KScanDialogFactory.
