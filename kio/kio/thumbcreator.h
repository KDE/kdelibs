/**
 * This is the baseclass for "thumbnail-plugins" in KDE. Using the class 
 * @ref KIO::PreviewJob allows you to generate small images (thumbnails)
 * for any kind of file, where a "ThumbCreator" is available. Have a look
 * at kdebase/kioslave/thumbnail/ for existing ThumbCreators.
 *
 * What you need to do to create and register a ThumbCreator:
 * @li Inherit from this class and reimplement the @ref create() method to
 *     generate a thumbnail for the given file-path.
 * @li Provide a factory method in your implementation file to instantiate
 * your plugin, e.g.:
 * <pre>
 * extern "C"
 * {
 *   ThumbCreator *new_creator()
 *   {
 *     return new YourThumbCreator();
 *   }
 * };
 * </pre>
 *
 * Compile your ThumbCreator as a module. The contents of Makefile.am
 * need to look like this:
 * <pre>
 * INCLUDES = $(all_includes)
 * LDFLAGS = $(all_libraries) $(KDE_RPATH)
 * kde_module_LTLIBRARIES = yourthumbcreator.la
 * yourthumbcreator_la_SOURCES = yourthumbcreator.cpp
 * yourthumbcreator_la_LIBADD = $(LIB_KIO)
 * yourthumbcreator_la_LDFLAGS = $(all_libraries) -module $(KDE_PLUGIN)
 * servicedir = $(kde_servicesdir)
 * service_DATA = yourthumbcreator.desktop
 * </pre>
 *
 * @li Create a file yourthumbcreator.desktop with the following contents:
 * <pre>
 * [Desktop Entry]
 * Encoding=UTF-8
 * Type=Service
 * Name=Name of the type of files your ThumbCreator supports
 * ServiceTypes=ThumbCreator
 * MimeTypes=application/x-somemimetype
 * CacheThumbnail=true
 * X-KDE-Library=yourthumbcreator
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can supply a comma-separated list of mimetypes to the MimeTypes entry,
 * naming all mimetypes your ThumbCreator supports. You can also use simple
 * wildcards, like text/* or image/*.
 *
 * If your plugin is rather inexpensive (e.g. like the text preview ThumbCreator),
 * you can set CacheThumbnail=false to prevent your thumbnails from being cached
 * on disk.
 *
 * @short Baseclass for thumbnail-generating plugins.
