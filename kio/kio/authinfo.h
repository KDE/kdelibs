/**
 * This class is intended to make it easier to prompt for, cache
 * and retrieve authorization information.
 *
 * When using this class to cache, retrieve or prompt authentication
 * information, you only need to set the necessary attributes. For
 * example, to check whether a password is already cached, the only
 * required information is the URL of the resource and optionally
 * whether or not a path match should be performed.  Similarly, to
 * prompt for password you only need to optionally set the prompt,
 * username (if already supplied), comment and commentLabel fields.
 *
 * <u>SPECIAL NOTE:</u> If you extend this class to add additional
 * paramters do not forget to overload the stream insertion and
 * extraction operators ("<<" and ">>") so that the added data can
 * be correctly serialzed.
 *
 * @short A two way messaging class for passing authentication information.
