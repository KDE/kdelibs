 * a file. If your thumbnail plugin can create a thumbnail sequence, you should base it
 * on ThumbSequenceCreator instead of ThumbCreator, and should use sequenceIndex()
 * to decide what thumbnail you generate.
 *
 * You also need to set the following key in the thumbcreator .desktop file
 * \code
 * HandleSequences=true;
 * \endcode
 *
 * @since 4.3

     * from the beginning, or continue in some other way.
