         *  @param w       Flags which serve as a preset which can be customized
         *                 with other parameters.
         *  @param iocost  The allowed cost in terms of io to retrieve the
         *                 metainfo. The approximate maximum number of bytes to
         *                 be read is 10^iocost. Negative values mean that
         *                 there is no limit on the cost. 0 means that no fields
         *                 other than the required fields will be retrieved.
         *                 The default value of 3 means about 1024 bytes per
         *                 file may be read. This is merely a suggestion and not
         *                 a hard limit.
         *  @param cpucost The allowed cost in terms of cpu to determine the
         *                 information in the fields. The number mean the amount
         *                 of instructions allowed is 10^cpucost and is a suggestion only.
         *                 The default value of 6 means that about a million
         *                 instructions (10^6) are allowed. This is useful for
         *                 expensive fields like md5 or thumbnails.
         *  @param requiredfields The names of fields or groups of fields that should
         *                  be retrieved regardless of cost.
         *  @param requestedfields The names of fields or groups of fields that should
         *                  be retrieved first.
