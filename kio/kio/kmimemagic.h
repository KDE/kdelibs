 * Unless specified otherwise, KMimeMagic uses
 * $KDEDIR/share/mimelnk/magic for this purpose.
 *
 * To make KMimeMagic restore the 'atime' of a file after it opened it,
 * add its directory in kmimemagicrc like:
 * [Settings]
 * atimeDirs=/tmp,/var/tmp,/home/dfaure/tmp
 * This isn't done by default because it changes the 'ctime'.
 * See kmimemagic.cpp for a full discussion on this issue.
 *
 * The basic usage of KMimeMagic is :
 * @li Get a pointer to it, using KMimeMagic::self().
 * @li Use it for any file or buffer you want, using one of the three
 * @p find...Type() methods.
 *
 * The result is contained in the class KMimeMagicResult.
