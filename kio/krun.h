 * To open files with their associated applications in KDE, use KRun.

 * the default application or another application "bound" to the file type.
 *
 * You need to create an instance of KFileOpenWithHandler before,
 * so that in case the mime-type of the file is unknown, or if there is
 * no application associated, KRun will bring up the "open with" dialog.
 * Example:
 * KFileOpenWithHandler fowh;
 * new KRun( url );
 *
 * In that example, the mimetype of the file is not known by the application,
 * so a KRun instance must be created. It will determine the mimetype by itself.
 * If the mimetype is known, or if you even know the service (application) to
 * use for this file, use one of the static methods.
