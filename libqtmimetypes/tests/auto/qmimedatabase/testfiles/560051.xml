  <itunes:summary>American Public Media&apos;s Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett is public radio&apos;s weekly conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Speaking of Faith does not always have religion itself as a subject. Week after week, it grapples with themes of civic life -- asking how perspectives of faith might distinctively inform and illuminate our public reflection. The Speaking of Faith podcast contains each week&apos;s program in its entirety and is updated every Thursday.</itunes:summary>

   <title>SOF FIRST PERSON (audio) | Repossessing Virtue: Prabhu Guptara on Applying Personal Moral Sense to One&apos;s Work Life</title>
   <description>As promised, we continue our SOF First Person project by turning to Swiss banking expert, Prabhu Guptara. Several years ago, Krista spoke with Guptara when the fallout of the Enron scandal was wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy and shaking investor confidence in corporate practices and business fundamentals. His message was simple but challenging, and also quite liberating for much of our audience -- bring your personal values into the workplace. For Guptara, doing this is one of the best ways of making ethical decisions that will lead to moral integrity -- and less corruption and scandal.</description>

   <title>The Sunni-Shia Divide and the Future of Islam (November 20, 2008)</title>
   <description>We seek fresh insight into the history and the human and religious dynamics of Islam&apos;s Sunni-Shia divide. Vali Nasr says that it is not so different from dynamics in periods of Western Christian history. But he says that by bringing the majority Shia to power in Iraq, the U.S. has changed the religions dynamics of the Middle East.</description>

     <title>Studs Terkel on Life, Faith, and Death (November 13, 2008)</title>
     <description>We remember Studs Terkel, who recently died at the age of 96. The legendary interviewer chronicled decades of ordinary life and tumultuous change in U.S. culture. We visited him in his Chicago home in 2004 and drew out his wisdom and warmth on large existential themes of life and death. A lifelong agnostic, Studs Terkel shared his thoughts on religion as he&apos;d observed it in his conversation partners, in culture, and in his own encounters with loss and mortality.</description>

     <title>Getting Revenge and Forgiveness (November 6, 2008)</title>
     <description>Professor of psychology Michael McCullough describes science that helps us comprehend how revenge came to have a purpose in human life. At the same time, he stresses, science is also revealing that human beings are more instinctively equipped for forgiveness than we&apos;ve perhaps given ourselves credit for. Knowing this suggests ways to calm the revenge instinct in ourselves and others and embolden the forgiveness intuition.</description>

     <title>Being Autistic, Being Human (October 16, 2008)</title>
     <description>One of every 150 children is now diagnosed to be somewhere on the mysterious spectrum of autism. We step back from the controversies about the causes and cures of autism and explore one family&apos;s experience with an autistic child. Jennifer Elder, an artist, and Paul Collins, a literary historian, have unearthed a vivid history of people grappling with autism, before it had a name. And they share what all of this is teaching them about what it means to be human.</description>

     <itunes:subtitle>Discovering the humanity, challenges, and gifts of autism with the parents of one child.</itunes:subtitle>
     <itunes:summary>One of every 150 children is now diagnosed to be somewhere on the mysterious spectrum of autism. We step back from the controversies about the causes and cures of autism and explore one family&apos;s experience with an autistic child. Jennifer Elder, an artist, and Paul Collins, a literary historian, have unearthed a vivid history of people grappling with autism, before it had a name. And they share what all of this is teaching them about what it means to be human.</itunes:summary>

		   <title>The Origins and Impact of Pentecostalism (September 18, 2008)</title>
		   <description>Pentecostalism has appeared as a force on both sides of the current presidential campaign. News coverage of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&apos;s Pentecostal background has overshadowed the fact that senior leaders of the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Convention are Pentecostal too. In 2006, Pentecostals from all around the globe traveled to the birthplace of this tradition -- Azusa Street in Los Angeles. We were there to cover the centennial celebration -- and now we bring this program into the present, exploring the origins, theology, and impact of this faith that now reaches an estimated half a billion people globally.</description>

	   <title>Fishing with Mystery (August 28, 2008)</title>
	   <description>James Prosek is a 33-year-old artist, writer, and fly-fisher who has always, as he puts it, found God &quot;through the theater of nature.&quot; From a young age he has been fascinated by trout, and now eel -- which he sees as &quot;mystical creatures&quot; -- and he&apos;s captured them physically and artistically, by way of both angling and paint. We explore the sense of meaning and ritual James Prosek developed along the way, including his concern with how we humans limit our sense of other creatures by the names we give them. We&apos;ll also hear the words of Henry David Thoreau, Bruce Chatwin, and Izaak Walton.</description>

Tolle shares his youthful experience of depression and despair -- suffering that led him to his own spiritual breakthrough, and ultimately, freedom and peace of mind. He also explicates his view of what he calls &quot;the pain body&quot; -- the accumulated emotional pain that may influence us and our relationships in negative ways. And Tolle talks about spirit and God, and what those concepts mean to him.</description>

   <title>Living Vodou (August 7, 2008)</title>
   <description>Vodou is the African-based spiritual world of the people of Haiti, a living religion wherever Haitians are found. It involves dramatic rituals and drumming, trances and dreaming, and belief in a spiritual realm that mirrors the physical world and interacts with it. But contrary to popular notions, it has nothing to do with sticking pins into dolls. With Patrick Bellegarde-Smith, a scholar who is also a Vodou priest, we explore its practices and metaphysics.</description>

     <title>Recovering Chinese Religiosities (July 17, 2008)</title>
     <description>Put the words &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;China&quot; in a sentence together, and Western imaginations may go to indifference at best, to brutal repression at worst. Yet in grand historical perspective, China is a crucible of religious and philosophical thought and practice. Anthropologist and filmmaker Mayfair Yang says that the upheavals of the 20th century created an amnesia -— in the West as in China itself -- about this rich, pluralistic spiritual inheritance. She traces some of this story for us, and describes a subtle new revival of reverence and ritual.</description>

     <title>Joe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual (July 10, 2008)</title>
     <description>The spiritual is celebrated in American culture and beyond. It is the source from which gospel, jazz, blues and hip-hop evolved. It was born in the American South, created by slaves, bards whose names history never recorded. The organizing concept of this music is not the melody of Europe, but the rhythm of Africa. And the theology conveyed in these songs is a potent mix of African spirituality, Hebrew narrative, Christian doctrine, and an extreme experience of human suffering.</description>

As a citizen and mother more than an expert, she turned her life towards questions many of us are asking. Food, she says, is a &quot;rare moral arena&quot; in which the ethical choice is often the pleasurable choice.</description>

     <title>Brother Thay: A Radio Pilgrimmage with Thich Nhat Hanh (April 10, 2008)</title>
     <description>Forcibly exiled from his native country, Zen master and poet Thich Nhat Hanh recently visited Vietnam for the first time in nearly 40 years. In 2003, Speaking of Faith took a radio pilgrimage with the Buddhist monk at a Christian conference center in a lakeside setting of rural Wisconsin. Thich Nhat Hanh offers stark, gentle wisdom for living in a world of anger and violence. Here, he discusses the concepts of engaged Buddhism, being peace, and mindfulness.</description>

     <title>The Spirituality of Parenting (April 3, 2008)</title>
     <description>More and more people in our time are disconnected from religious institutions, at least for part of their lives. Others are religious and find themselves creating a family with a spouse from another tradition or no tradition at all. And the experience of parenting tends to raise spiritual questions anew. We sense that there is a spiritual aspect to our children&apos;s natures and wonder how to support and nurture that. The spiritual life, our guest says, begins not in abstractions, but in concrete everyday experiences. And children need our questions as much as our answers.</description>

     <title>Exploring a New Humanism (March 27, 2008)</title>
     <description>In a recent Pew poll, 16 percent of Americans identified themselves as &quot;unaffiliated&quot; - atheist, agnostic, or most prominently &quot;nothing in particular.&quot; Greg Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard, described himself that way until he discovered the tradition of humanism. He is passionate about articulating an atheist identity that is not driven by a stance against religion but by positive ethical beliefs and actions.</description>

   <title>The Need for Creeds (March 20, 2008)</title>
   <description>For many modern Americans, the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed, composed centuries ago, is troublesome. But, Jaroslav Pelikan, who died on May 13, 2006, was a scholar who devoted his life to exploring the vitality of ancient theology and creeds. He insisted that even modern pluralists need strong statements of belief. Here, we revisit Krista&apos;s 2003 conversation with him, who, then, in his 80th year, had released a historic collection of Christian faith from biblical times to the present and from across the globe. They discuss the history and nature of creeds, and how a fixed creed can be reconciled with an honest, intellectual faith that changes and evolves.</description>

   <title>Liberating the Founders (March 13, 2008)</title>
   <description>Warning: this conversation may not mirror what you learned in school. The culture wars of recent years, journalist Steven Waldman says, hijacked Americans&apos; understanding of the country&apos;s founders and of the meaning of religious liberty. This hinders people from grasping what is really at stake in the current debates about the relationship between government and religion. It may even distort the wisdom we might bring to young democracies around the world.</description>

   <title>The Inner Landscape of Beauty (February 28, 2008)</title>
   <description>John O&apos;Donohue was an Irish poet and philosopher beloved for his book &quot;Anam Cara&quot; — Gaelic for &quot;soul friend&quot; — and for his insistence on beauty as a human calling and a defining aspect of God. Before his untimely death this year, he spoke with Krista in our studios. And so this hour has become a remembrance of him. But John O&apos;Donohue had a very Celtic, lifelong fascination with what he called &quot;the invisible world.&quot; And he would also surely see this also as a serendipitous continuation of his life&apos;s work — of bringing ancient Celtic wisdom to modern confusions and longings.</description>

   <title>Whale Songs and Elephant Loves (February 21, 2008)</title>
   <description>Katy Payne is an acoustic biologist with a Quaker sensibility. In a career that has spanned the wild coast of Argentina and the rainforests of Africa, she discovered that humpback whales compose ever-changing songs; and that elephants communicate across long distances by way of sounds beyond the realm of human hearing. She reflects on life in this world through listening to two of its largest and most mysterious creatures.</description>

   <title>No More Taking Sides (February 14, 2008)</title>
   <description>Robi Damelin lost her son David to a Palestinian sniper. Ali Abu Awwad lost his older brother Yousef to an Israeli soldier. But, instead of clinging to traditional ideologies and turning their pain into more violence, they&apos;ve decided to understand the other side -- Israeli and Palestinian -- by sharing their pain and their humanity. They tell of a gathering network of survivors who share their grief, their stories of loved ones, and their ideas for lasting peace. They don&apos;t want to be right; they want to be honest.</description>

   <title>Reflections of a British Muslim Extremist (February 7, 2008)</title>
   <description>British activist Ed Husain was seduced, at the age of 16, by revolutionary Islamist ideals that flourished at the heart of educated British culture. Yet he later shrank back from radicalism after coming close to a murder and watching people he loved become suicide bombers. He dug deeper into Islamic spirituality, and now offers a fresh and daring perspective on the way forward.</description>

   <title>Inside Mormon Faith (January 24, 2008)</title>
   <description>Americans have been hearing about Mormonism in the context of the presidential campaign. But we&apos;re learning about this faith of 13 million people indirectly, by way of rhetoric and defense. In this program, we avoid well-trodden, controversial ground and seek an understanding of some doctrinal and spiritual basics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Robert Millet, a leading scholar of the church and a lifelong practitioner, describes a developing young religion with distinct mystical and practical interpretations of the nature of God, family, and eternity.</description>

   <title>Diplomacy and Religion in the 21st Century (January 3, 2008)</title>
   <description>The greatest threat in the post-Cold War world, says Douglas Johnston, is the prospective marriage of religious extremism with weapons of mass destruction. Yet the U.S. spends most of its time, resources, and weapons fighting the symptoms of this threat, not the cause. The diplomacy of the future, he is showing, must engage religion as part of the strategic solution to global conflicts.</description>

   <title>SOF EXTRA (video) | The Homes and Voices of Mason&apos;s Bend</title>
   <description>Auburn University&apos;s Rural Studio in western Alabama draws architectural students into the design and construction of homes and public spaces in some of the poorest counties in the United States. They&apos;re creating beautiful and economical structures that are unique in the world — and that nurture sustainability of the natural world as of human dignity. The iconographic structures of Mason&apos;s Bend have become synonymous with Sam Mockbee and the Rural Studio. We&apos;ve put together a feast of images and voices from the people who live and work there.

   <title>SOF EXTRA (audio) | Krista&apos;s Commentary on Consumption and Sustainability</title>
   <description>Krista says the globe should welcome the challenge of sustainability as an invitation -- a way to strengthen moral resources such as delight, dignity, elegance, and hope: 
			
			Our emerging national conversation about sustainability has a decidedly &quot;eat your spinach&quot; tone. We&apos;re steeling ourselves to enter the realm of sacrifice, and penance. But as I&apos;ve explored ethics and meaning in American life these past few years, I&apos;ve been struck by the heightened sense of delight and beauty in lives and communities pursuing a new alignment with the natural world. 
			
			Innovation in sustainability often begins, I&apos;ve found, with people defining what they cherish as much as diagnosing what is wrong. I think of Majora Carter. The cutting-edge project she founded, Sustainable South Bronx, began when she and the people of that borough began to reclaim their riverfront for refreshment and play. 
			
			I think also of the author Barbara Kingsolver, who found in a year of sustainable eating that when it comes to food, the ethical choice is also the pleasurable choice. And she says that as we face the grand ecological crises of our time, one of our most important renewable resources is hope. We simply have to put it on with our shoes every morning. 
			
			Recently we visited the Rural Studio at Auburn University in Alabama. There, architectural students build elegant homes and public spaces in poor communities. Long before sustainability was fashionable, the Rural Studio was innovating &quot;zero-maintenance&quot; design. This architectural philosophy shelters the body while honoring the environment and human dignity. 
			
			The writer Frederich Buechner has said that &quot;vocation&quot; happens when our deep gladness meets the world&apos;s deep need. I&apos;d like to propose the work of sustainability as an unfolding vocation – not merely a response to problems, but an invitation to possibility and a way to strengthen moral resources such as delight, dignity, elegance, and hope.</description>

   <title>An Architecture of Decency (November 15, 2007)</title>
   <description>We travel to western Alabama to the Rural Studio. Scattered across it are some 75 works of livable art — elegant, sustainable homes and public buildings in some of the poorest counties in the United States. They&apos;re the products of an architectural adventure. Here, architecture serves as a &quot;social art&quot; — and as a force for repairing the fabric of human community as well as the natural world.</description>

   <title>The Ethics of Eating (July 19, 2007)</title>
   <description>Author Barbara Kingsolver describes an adventure her family undertook to spend one year eating primarily what they could grow or raise themselves. As a citizen and mother more than an expert, she turned her life towards questions many of us are asking. What can climate change and sustainability really have to do my family&apos;s daily routines? Where does the food we eat come from? And why do we resist when the healthiest choices can be a delight?</description>

   <title>Stress and the Balance Within (July 12, 2007)</title>
   <description>Dr. Esther Sternberg works at the molecular level of the mind-body connection. The language of genes, neurotransmitters, and hormones, as she describes it, is helping science understand how our emotions and our bodies are connected -- why stress can make us sick, and loving and believing can help us be well.</description>

   <title>Marriage, Family, and Divorce (July 5, 2007)</title>
   <description>American ideals of courtship and marriage echo with Biblical imagery — &quot;bone of my bones&quot; &quot;flesh of my flesh.&quot; But what does the Bible really say, and how has it been taught across the centuries in which the institution of marriage has changed dramatically? With a rabbi and a New Testament scholar, we explore nuances of biblical teachings about marriage, family, and divorce — the surprising ambiguities of the New Testament and the striking practicality of Jewish tradition across the ages.</description>

   <title>Living Vodou (June 28, 2007)</title>
   <description>Vodou is the African-based spiritual world of the people of Haiti, a living religion wherever Haitians are found. It involves dramatic rituals and drumming, trances and dreaming, and belief in a spiritual realm that mirrors the physical world and interacts with it. But contrary to popular notions, it has nothing to do with sticking pins into dolls. With Patrick Bellegarde-Smith, a scholar who is also a Vodou priest, we explore its practices and metaphysics.</description>

   <description>A film based on Mariane Pearl&apos;s memoir, &quot;A Mighty Heart,&quot; opens in theaters, with Angelina Jolie in the starring role.

   <title>Joe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual (June 14, 2007)</title>
   <description>We celebrate the life of performer, educator, and humanitarian Joe Carter with his exploration in word and song of the meaning of the African-American spiritual. Before his death last year at the age of 57, he traveled the world and introduced the spiritual to audiences from Novosibirsk to Nigeria. He had a singular understanding of the religious sensibility of this music -- its hidden meanings, as well as its beauty, lament, and hope.</description>

   <title>The Evolution of American Evangelicalism (April 12, 2007)</title>
   <description>Last month, conservative Christian leaders demanded that Richard Cizik be silenced or removed from his post. They charged that his concerns about climate change and torture have shifted attention away from moral issues such as gay marriage and abortion. But for Cizik, poverty, war, and the environment are moral issues too. We revisit Krista&apos;s 2006 conversation with Cizik that took many listeners by surprise.</description>

   <title>Children of Abraham (February 8, 2007)</title>
   <description>Abraham is the common patriarch of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. His story spans dramatic territory of the modern world — both physical and spiritual — beginning in southern Iraq and ending in the West Bank city of Hebron. Journalist Bruce Feiler went in search of Abraham to understand the crises and possibilities of the 21st-century world. The story of Abraham, Feiler says, illuminates God and politics, sacred geography, and modern spirituality.</description>

His story spans dramatic territory of the modern world — both physical and spiritual — beginning in southern Iraq and ending in the West Bank city of Hebron. Journalist Bruce Feiler went in search of Abraham to understand the crises and possibilities of the 21st-century world. The story of Abraham, Feiler says, illuminates God and politics, sacred geography, and modern spirituality.</itunes:summary>

In a career that has spanned the wild coast of Argentina and the rainforests of Africa, she discovered that humpback whales compose ever-changing songs; and that elephants communicate across long distances by way of sounds beyond the realm of human hearing.

   <title>Diplomacy and Religion in the 21st Century (January 25, 2007)</title>
   <description>The greatest threat in the post-Cold War world, says Douglas Johnston, is the prospective marriage of religious extremism with weapons of mass destruction. Yet the U.S. spends most of its time, resources, and weapons fighting the symptoms of this threat, not the cause. The diplomacy of the future, he is showing, must engage religion as part of the strategic solution to global conflicts.</description>

   <title>Discovering Where We Live: Reimagining Environmentalism (January 11, 2007)</title>
   <description>Environmentalism and climate change are hot topics; yet they&apos;re still often imagined as the territory of scientists, expert activists, and those who can afford to be environmentally conscious. We discover two people who are transforming the ecology of their immediate worlds — Majora Carter, a secular urban strategist unraveling ties between ecology and injustice as she strives for balance and beauty in the South Bronx; and Calvin DeWitt, a scientist and evangelical Christian who&apos;s been pioneering sustainability in the rural Midwest for three decades.</description>

   <title>No More Taking Sides: An Israeli-Palestinian Story (December 14, 2006)</title>
   <description>Robi Damelin lost her son David to a Palestinian sniper. Ali Abu Awwad lost his older brother Yousef to an Israeli soldier. But, instead of clinging to traditional ideologies and turning their pain into more violence, they&apos;ve decided to understand the other side — Israeli and Palestinian — by sharing their pain and their humanity. They tell of a gathering network of survivors who share their grief, their stories of loved ones, and their ideas for lasting peace. They don&apos;t want to be right; they want to be honest.</description>

   <title>Hearing Muslim Voices Since 9/11 (September 7, 2006)</title>
   <description>Dramatic headlines convey a predominantly violent picture of global Islam.

And, Krista Tippett speaks with Seyyed Hossein Nasr, an esteemed Muslim scholar who brings a broad religious and historical perspective to hard questions about Islam and the West that have lingered uncomfortably in American life since 9/11.</description>

   <title>The Freelance Monotheism of Karen Armstrong (August 17, 2006)</title>
   <description>Karen Armstrong speaks about her progression from a disillusioned and damaged young nun into, in her words, a &quot;freelance monotheist.&quot; She&apos;s a formidable thinker and scholar, but as a theologian she calls herself an amateur -- noting that the Latin root of the word &quot;amateur&quot; means a love of one&apos;s subject. Seven years in a strict religious order nearly snuffed out her ability to think about faith at all. Here, we hear the story behind Armstrong&apos;s developing ideas about God.</description>

He traveled the world and introduced the spiritual to audiences from Novosibirsk to Nigeria. He had a singular understanding of the religious sensibility of this music — its hidden meanings, as well as its beauty, lament, and hope.</itunes:summary>

   <title>Heart and Soul: The Integrative Medicine of Dr. Mehmet Oz (June 22, 2006)</title>
   <description>The word healing means to make whole. But historically, in a field like cardiology, Western medicine has taken a divided view of human health. It has stressed medical treatment of biological ailments. Cardiovascular surgeon Mehmet Oz speaks about the intersection of Western medicine, human spirituality, and the physiology of the human heart.</description>

   <description>How do parents and grandparents nurture the spiritual and moral awareness of the children in our lives? Rabbi Sandy Sasso has written books that help children and adults of many backgrounds discuss religion and ethics together.

   <title>A History of Doubt (June 8, 2006)</title>
   <description>Our guest, poet and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht, says that as a scholar she always noticed the &quot;shadow history&quot; of doubt out of the corner of her eye. She shows how non-belief, skepticism, and doubt have paralleled and at times shaped the world&apos;s great religious and secular belief systems. She suggests that only in modern time has doubt been narrowly equated with a complete rejection of faith, or a broader sense of mystery.</description>

   <title>The Need for Creeds (May 18, 2006)</title>
   <description>For many modern Americans, the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed, composed centuries ago, is troublesome. But, Jaroslav Pelikan, a scholar who has devoted his life to exploring the vitality of ancient theology and creeds, insists that even modern pluralists need strong statements of belief. Here, we revisit Krista&apos;s 2003 conversation with him, who, then, in his 80th year, had released a historic collection of Christian faith from biblical times to the present and from across the globe. They discuss the history and nature of creeds, and how a fixed creed can be reconciled with an honest, intellectual faith that changes and evolves.</description>
