/*
 * Explanation on how the resolver system works

   When KResolver::start is called, it calls KResolverManager::enqueue to add
   an entry to the queue. KResolverManager::enqueue will verify the availability
   of a worker thread: if one is available, it will dispatch the request to it.
   If no threads are available, it will then decide whether to launch a thread
   or to queue for the future.

   (This process is achieved by always queueing the new request, starting a
   new thread if necessary and then notifying of the availability of data
   to all worker threads).

 * Worker thread
   A new thread, when started, will enter its event loop
   immediately. That is, it'll first try to acquire new data to
   process, which means it will lock and unlock the manager mutex in
   the process.

   If it finds no new data, it'll wait on the feedWorkers condition
   for a certain maximum time. If that time expires and there's still
   no data, the thread will exit, in order to save system resources.

   If it finds data, however, it'll set up and call the worker class
   that has been selected by the manager. Once that worker is done,
   the thread releases the data through KResolverManager::releaseData.

 * Data requesting/releasing
   A worker thread always calls upon functions on the resolver manager
   in order to acquire and release data.

   When data is being requested, the KResolverManager::requestData
   function will look the currentRequests list and return the first
   Queued request it finds, while marking it to be InProgress.

   When the worker class has returned, the worker thread will release
   that data through the KResolverManager::releaseData function. If the
   worker class has requested no further data (nRequests == 0), the
   request's status is marked to be Done. It'll then look at the
   requestor for that data: if it was requested by another worker,
   it'll decrement the requests count for that one and add the results
   to a list. And, finally, if the requests count for the requestor
   becomes 0, it'll repeat this process for the requestor as well
   (change status to Done, check for a requestor).
