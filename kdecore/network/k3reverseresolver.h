 * as it produces a reverse resolution: it resolves a socket address
 * from its binary representations into a textual representation.
 *
 * Most users will use the static functions resolve(), which work
 * both synchronously (blocking) and asynchronously (non-blocking).

   * setting resolution parameters. The possible values are:
   * @li NumericHost: don't try to resolve the host address to a text form.
   *		Instead, convert the address to its numeric textual representation.
   * @li NumericService: the same as NumericHost, but for the service name
   * @li NodeNameOnly: returns the node name only (i.e., not the Fully
   *		Qualified Domain Name)
   * @li Datagram: in case of ambiguity in the service name, prefer the
   *		name associated with the datagram protocol
   * @li NumericScope: for those addresses which have the concept of scope,
   *            resolve using the numeric value instead of the proper scope name.
   * @li ResolutionRequired: normally, when resolving, if the name resolution
   *            fails, the process normally converts the numeric address into its
   *            presentation forms. This flag causes the function to return
   *            with error instead.
