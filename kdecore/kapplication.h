/**
* Controls and provides information to all KDE applications.
*
* Only one object of this class can be instantiated in a single app.
* This instance is always accessible via the @ref kApplication() method.
*
* This class provides the following services to all KDE applications.
*
* @li It controls the event queue (see @ref QApplication ).
* @li It provides the application with KDE resources such as
* accelerators, common menu entries, a @ref KConfig object. session
* management events, help invocation etc.
* @li Installs a signal handler for the SIGCHLD signal in order to
* avoid zombie children. If you want to catch this signal yourself or
* don't want it to be caught at all, you have set a new signal handler
* (or SIG_IGN) after KApplication's constructor has run.
* @li It can start new services
*
*
* The way a service gets started depends on the 'X-DCOP-ServiceType'
* entry in the desktop file of the service:
*
* There are three possibilities:
* @li X-DCOP-ServiceType=None (default)
*    Always start a new service,
*    don't wait till the service registers with dcop.
* @li X-DCOP-ServiceType=Multi
*    Always start a new service,
*    wait until the service has registered with dcop.
* @li X-DCOP-ServiceType=Unique
*    Only start the service if it isn't already running,
*    wait until the service has registered with dcop.
* 
* @short Controls and provides information to all KDE applications.
