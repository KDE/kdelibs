 *
 * KURL has some restrictions regarding the path
 * encoding. KURL works internally with the decoded path and
 * and encoded query. For example,
 * <pre>
 * http://localhost/cgi-bin/test%20me.pl?cmd=Hello%20you
 * </pre>
 * would result in a decoded path "/cgi-bin/test me.pl"
 * and in the encoded query "?cmd=Hello%20you".
 * Since path is internally always encoded you may @em not use
 * "%00" in the path, although this is OK for the query.
