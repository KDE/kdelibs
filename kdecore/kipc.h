/**
 * This class implements a very simple IPC mechanism for KDE. You can send
 * a message of a predefined type to either a specific application, or to all
 * KDE application on the current display. The message can carry one integer of
 * data.
 *
 * KIPC is mainly used in KDE for sending "Change Messages", i.e. a message to
 * all KDE apps that a certain setting (the font, for example) has changed.
 * For anything more complex it is recommended to use DCOP -- the Desktop
 * Communications Protocol.
 *
 * Messages with id code < 32 are called "System Messages". These are
 * directly handled by KApplication. Examples are: PaletteChanged and
 * StyleChanged. Messages with id code >= 32 are user messages. KApplication
 * emits the signal kipcMessage(id,arg) for each user message it receives.
 *
 * KIPC is implemented using X11 ClientMessage events.
 *
 * @see KApplication::kipcMessage()
