/*
 * The KBufferedIO class has two purposes: first, it defines an API on how
 * that classes providing buffered I/O should provide. Next, it implements on
 * top of that API a generic buffering, that should suffice for most cases.
 *
 * The buffering implemented consists of two separate buffer areas, one for
 * the input (or read) buffer, and one for the output (or write) buffer. Each
 * of those buffers is implemented through a QList of QByteArrays instead of
 * simply QByteArrays. The idea is that, instead of having one large, contiguous
 * buffer area, we have several small ones. Even though this could be seen as
 * a waste of memory, it makes our life easier, because we can just append a new
 * QByteArray to the list and not have to worry with copying the rest of the
 * buffer, should we need to expand.
 *
 * This way, we have the capability of unlimited buffering, which can grow to
 * the extent of available memory.
 *
 * For each buffer, we provide three kinds of functions, available as protected
 * members: consume, feed and size. The size functions calculate the current
 * size of the buffer, by adding each individual QByteArray size. The feed
 * functions are used by the I/O functions that receive data from somewhere,
 * i.e., from the system, in the case of the input buffer, and from the user,
 * in the case of the output buffer. These two functions are used to give
 * the buffers more data. And the consume functions are used by the functions
 * that send out data (to the system, for the write buffer, and to the user,
 * for the read buffer).
 *
 * Note that for your own implementation, you can have your readBlock function
 * merely call consumeReadBuffer, similarly to peekBlock. As for
 * the writeBlock function, you'd call feedWriteBuffer.
 *
 * Now, the function receiving data from the system will need to simply call
 * feedReadBuffer, much in the same way of unreadBlock. The tricky part is
 * for the output function. We do not provide a member function that copies
 * data from the output buffer into another buffer for sending. We believe that
 * would be a waste of resources and CPU time, since you'd have to allocate
 * that buffer, copy data into it and then call the OS, which will likely just
 * copy data out of it.
 *
 * Instead, we found it better to leave it to you to access outBuf member
 * variable directly and use the buffers there. Should you want to copy that
 * into a larger buffer before sending, that's up to you.
 *
 * Both buffers work in the same way: they're an "array" of buffers, each
 * concatenated to the other. All data in all buffers is valid data, except
 * for the first QByteArray, whose valid data starts at inBufIndex/outBufIndex
 * bytes from the start. That is, the data starts in the first QByteArray buffer
 * that many bytes from the start and goes on contiguously until the last
 * QByteArray. This has been decided like that because we didn't want to
 * create a new QByteArray of the remaining bytes in the first buffer, after
 * a consume operation, because that could take some time. It is faster
 * this way, although not really easy.
 *
 * If you want to take a look at an implementation of a buffered I/O class,
 * refer to KExtendedSocket's source code.
