/** @defgroup timezones Time zone classes
 *
 * The time zone classes provide a framework for accessing time zone data, and
 * converting times and dates between different time zones. They provide access
 * to the system time zone database, and also allow developers to derive classes
 * to access custom sources of time zone information such as calendar files.
 *
 * A time zone is represented by the KTimeZone class. This provides access to
 * the time zone's detailed definition and contains methods to convert times to
 * and from that zone. In order to save processing, KTimeZone obtains its time
 * zone details only when they are actually required. Each KTimeZone class has
 * a corresponding KTimeZoneBackend backend class which implements reference
 * counting of the time zone's data.
 *
 * A collection of time zones is represented by the KTimeZones class, which acts
 * as a container of KTimeZone objects. Within any KTimeZones object, each
 * KTimeZone instance is uniquely identified by its name. Typically, each
 * individual source of time zone information would be represented by a different
 * KTimeZones object. This scheme allows conflicting time zone definitions
 * between the different sources to be handled, since KTimeZone names need only
 * be unique within a single KTimeZones object. Note that KTimeZone instances do
 * not have to belong to any KTimeZones container.
 *
 * Time zone source data can come in all sorts of different forms: TZFILE format
 * for a UNIX system time zone database, definitions within calendar files, calls
 * to libraries (e.g. libc), etc. The KTimeZoneSource class provides reading and
 * parsing functions to access such data, handing off the parsed data for a
 * specific time zone in a KTimeZoneData object. Both of these are base classes
 * from which should be derived other classes which know about the particular
 * access method and data format (KTimeZoneSource) and which details are actually
 * provided (KTimeZoneData). When a KTimeZone instance needs its time zone's
 * definition, it calls KTimeZoneSource::parse() and receives the data back in a
 * KTimeZoneData object which it keeps for reference.
 *
 * KTimeZoneData holds the definitions of the different daylight saving time and
 * standard time phases in KTimeZone::Phase objects, and the timed sequence of
 * daylight saving time changes in KTimeZone::Transition objects. Leap seconds
 * adjustments are held in KTimeZone::LeapSeconds objects. You can access this
 * data directly via KTimeZone and KTimeZoneData methods if required.
 *
 * The mapping of the different classes to external data is as follows:
 *
 * - Each different source data format or access method is represented by a
 *   different KTimeZoneSource class.
 *
 * - Each different set of data provided from source data is represented by a
 *   different KTimeZoneData class. For example, some time zone sources provide
 *   only the absolute basic information about time zones, i.e. name, transition
 *   times and offsets from UTC. Others provide information on leap second
 *   adjustments, while still others might contain information on which countries
 *   use the time zone. To allow for this variation, KTimeZoneData is made
 *   available for inheritance. When the necessary information is not available,
 *   the KTimeZone::Phase, KTimeZone::Transition and KTimeZone::LeapSeconds data
 *   will be empty.
 *
 * - Each KTimeZoneData class will have a corresponding KTimeZone class, and
 *   related KTimeZoneBackend class, which can interpret its data.
 *
 * - Each different source database will typically be represented by a different
 *   KTimeZones instance, to avoid possible conflicts between time zone definitions.
 *   If it is known that two source databases are definitely compatible, they can
 *   be grouped together into the same KTimeZones instance.
 *
 *
 * \section sys System time zones
 *
 * Access to system time zones is provided by the KSystemTimeZones class, which
 * reads the zone.tab file to obtain the list of system time zones, and creates a
 * KSystemTimeZone instance for each one. KSystemTimeZone has a
 * KSystemTimeZoneBackend backend class, and uses the KSystemTimeZoneSource
 * and KSystemTimeZoneData classes to obtain time zone data via libc library
 * functions.
 *
 * Normally, KSystemTimeZoneSource and KSystemTimeZoneData operate in the
 * background and you will not need to use them directly.
 *
 * @warning The KSystemTimeZone class uses the standard system libraries to
 * access time zone data, and its functionality is limited to what these libraries
 * provide. On many systems, dates earlier than 1902 are not handled, and on
 * non-GNU systems there is no guarantee that the time zone abbreviation returned
 * for a given date will be correct if the abbreviations applicable then were
 * not those currently in use. The KSystemTimeZones::readZone() method overcomes
 * these restrictions by reading the time zone definition directly from the
 * system time zone database files.
 *
 * \section tzfile Tzfile access
 *
 * The KTzfileTimeZone class provides access to tzfile(5) time zone definition
 * files, which are used to form the time zone database on UNIX systems. Usually,
 * for current information, it is easier to use the KSystemTimeZones class to
 * access system tzfile data. However, for dealing with past data the
 * KTzfileTimeZone class provides better guarantees of accurary, although it
 * cannot handle dates earlier than 1902. It also provides more detailed
 * information, and allows you to read non-system tzfile files. Alternatively,
 * the KSystemTimeZones::readZone() method uses the KTzfileTimeZone class to
 * read system time zone definition files.
 *
 * KTzfileTimeZone has a KTzfileTimeZoneBackend backend class, and uses the
 * KTzfileTimeZoneSource and KTzfileTimeZoneData classes to obtain time zone
 * data from tzfile files.
 *
 *
 * \section deriving Handling time zone data from other sources
 *
 * To implement time zone classes to access a new time zone data source, you need
 * as a minimum to derive a new class from KTimeZoneSource, and implement one or
 * more parse() methods. If you can know in advance what KTimeZone instances to create
 * without having to parse the source data, you should reimplement the virtual method
 * KTimeZoneSource::parse(const KTimeZone&). Otherwise, you need to define your
 * own parse() methods with appropriate signatures, to both read and parse the new
 * data, and create new KTimeZone instances.
 *
 * If the data for each time zone which is available from the new source happens
 * to be the same as for another source for which KTimeZone classes already exist,
 * you could simply use the existing KTimeZone, KTimeZoneBackend and KTimeZoneData
 * derived classes to receive the parsed data from your new KTimeZoneSource class:
 *
 * \code
 * class NewTimeZoneSource : public KTimeZoneSource
 * {
 *     public:
 *         NewTimeZoneSource(...);  // parameters might include location of data source ...
 *         ~NewTimeZoneSource();
 *
 *         // Option 1: reimplement KTimeZoneSource::parse() if you can
 *         // pre-create the KTimeZone instances.
 *         KTimeZoneData *parse(const KTimeZone &zone) const;
 *
 *         // Option 2: implement new parse() methods if you don't know
 *         // in advance what KTimeZone instances to create.
 *         void parse(..., KTimeZones *zones) const;
 *         NewTimeZone *parse(...) const;
 * };
 *
 * // Option 1:
 * KTimeZoneData *NewTimeZoneSource::parse(const KTimeZone &zone) const
 * {
 *     QString zoneName = zone.name();
 *     ExistingTimeZoneData* data = new ExistingTimeZoneData();
 *
 *     // Read the data for 'zoneName' from the new data source.
 *
 *     // Parse what we have read, and write it into 'data'.
 *     // Compile the sequence of daylight savings changes and leap
 *     // seconds adjustments (if available) and write into 'data'.
 *
 *     return data;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the data from the new source is different from what any existing
 * KTimeZoneData class contains, you will need to implement new KTimeZone,
 * KTimeZoneBackend and KTimeZoneData classes in addition to the KTimeZoneSource
 * class illustrated above:
 *
 * \code
 * class NewTimeZone : public KTimeZone
 * {
 *     public:
 *         NewTimeZone(NewTimeZoneSource *source, const QString &name, ...);
 *         ~NewTimeZone();
 *
 *         // Methods implementing KTimeZone virtual methods are implemented
 *         // in NewTimeZoneBackend, not here.
 *
 *         // Anything else which you need
 *     private:
 *         // No d-pointer !
 * };
 *
 * class NewTimeZoneBackend : public KTimeZoneBackend
 * {
 *     public:
 *         NewTimeZoneBackend(NewTimeZoneSource *source, const QString &name, ...);
 *         ~NewTimeZoneBackend();
 *
 *         KTimeZoneBackend *clone() const;
 *
 *         // Virtual methods which need to be reimplemented
 *         int offsetAtZoneTime(const KTimeZone *caller, const QDateTime &zoneDateTime, int *secondOffset = 0) const;
 *         int offsetAtUtc(const KTimeZone *caller, const QDateTime &utcDateTime) const;
 *         int offset(const KTimeZone *caller, time_t t) const;
 *         int isDstAtUtc(const KTimeZone *caller, const QDateTime &utcDateTime) const;
 *         bool isDst(const KTimeZone *caller, time_t t) const;
 *
 *         // Anything else which you need
 *     private:
 *         NewTimeZonePrivate *d;   // non-const !
 * };
 *
 * class NewTimeZoneData : public KTimeZoneData
 * {
 *         friend class NewTimeZoneSource;
 *
 *     public:
 *         NewTimeZoneData();
 *         ~NewTimeZoneData();
 *
 *         // Virtual methods which need to be reimplemented
 *         KTimeZoneData *clone() const;
 *         QList<QByteArray> abbreviations() const;
 *         QByteArray abbreviation(const QDateTime &utcDateTime) const;
 *
 *         // Data members containing whatever is read by NewTimeZoneSource
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * Here is a guide to implementing the offset() and offsetAtUtc() methods, in
 * the case where the source data does not use time_t for its time measurement:
 *
 * \code
 * int NewTimeZoneBackend::offsetAtUtc(const KTimeZone *caller, const QDateTime &utcDateTime) const
 * {
 *     // Access this time zone's data. If we haven't already read it,
 *     // force a read from source now.
 *     NewTimeZoneData *zdata = caller->data(true);
 *
 *     // Use 'zdata' contents to work out the UTC offset
 *
 *     return offset;
 * }
 *
 * int NewTimeZoneBackend::offset(const KTimeZone *caller, time_t t) const
 * {
 *     return offsetAtUtc(KTimeZone::fromTime_t(t));
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The other NewTimeZoneBackend methods would work in an analogous way to
 * NewTimeZoneBackend::offsetAtUtc() and NewTimeZoneBackend::offset().

/**
 * Base class representing a time zone.
 *
 * The KTimeZone base class contains general descriptive data about the time zone, and
 * provides an interface for methods to read and parse time zone definitions, and to
 * translate between UTC and local time. Derived classes must implement these methods,
 * and may also hold the actual details of the dates and times of daylight savings
 * changes, offsets from UTC, etc. They should be tailored to deal with the type and
 * format of data held by a particular type of time zone database.
 *
 * If this base class is instantiated as a valid instance, it always represents the
 * UTC time zone.
 *
 * KTimeZone is designed to work in partnership with KTimeZoneSource. KTimeZone
 * provides access to individual time zones, while classes derived from
 * KTimeZoneSource read and parse a particular format of time zone definition.
 * Because time zone sources can differ in what information they provide about time zones,
 * the parsed data retured by KTimeZoneSource can vary between different sources,
 * resulting in the need to create different KTimeZone classes to handle the data.
 *
 * KTimeZone instances are often grouped into KTimeZones collections.
 *
 * Copying KTimeZone instances is very efficient since the class data is explicitly
 * shared, meaning that only a pointer to the data is actually copied. To achieve
 * this, each class inherited from KTimeZone must have a corresponding backend
 * class derived from KTimeZoneBackend.
 *
 * @note Classes derived from KTimeZone should not have their own d-pointer. The
 * d-pointer is instead contained in their backend class (derived from
 * KTimeZoneBackend). This allows KTimeZone's reference-counting of private data to
 * take care of the derived class's data as well, ensuring that instance data is
 * not deleted while any references to the class instance remains. All virtual
 * methods which override KTimeZone virtual methods must be defined in the
 * backend class instead.
