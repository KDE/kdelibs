/**
 * @short A class representing a date and time with an associated time zone
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - @ref intro
 *  - @ref manipulation
 *  - @ref compatibility
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The class KDateTime combines a date and time with support for an
 * associated time zone or UTC offset. When manipulating KDateTime objects,
 * their time zones or UTC offsets are automatically taken into account. KDateTime
 * can also be set to represent a date-only value with no associated time.
 *
 * The class uses QDateTime internally to represent date/time values, and
 * therefore uses the Gregorian calendar for dates starting from 15 October 1582,
 * and the Julian calendar for dates up to 4 October 1582. The minimum year
 * number is -4712 (4713 BC), while the upper limit is more than 11,000,000. The
 * actual adoption of the Gregorian calendar after 1582 was slow; the last European
 * country to adopt it, Greece, did so only in 1923. See QDateTime Considerations
 * section below for further discussion of the date range limitations.
 *
 * The time specification types which KDateTime supports are:
 * - the UTC time zone
 * - a local time with a specified offset from UTC
 * - a local time in a specified time zone
 * - a local time using the current system time zone (a special case of the
 *   previous item)
 * - local clock time, using whatever the local system clock says on whichever
 *   computer it happens to be on. In this case, the equivalent UTC time will
 *   vary depending on system. As a result, calculations involving local clock
 *   times do not necessarily produce reliable results.
 *
 * These characteristics are more fully described in the description of the
 * SpecType enumeration. Also see
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">W3C: Working with Time Zones</a>
 * for a good overview of the different ways of representing times.
 *
 * To set the time specification, use one of the setTimeSpec() methods, to get
 * the time specification, call timeSpec(), isUtc(), isLocalZone(),
 * isOffsetFromUtc() or isClockTime(). To determine whether two KDateTime
 * instances have the same time specification, call timeSpec() on each and
 * compare the returned values using KDateTime::Spec::operator==().
 *
 * @section manipulation Date and Time Manipulation
 *
 * A KDateTime object can be created by passing a date and time in its
 * constructor, together with a time specification.
 *
 * If both the date and time are null, isNull() returns true. If the date, time
 * and time specification are all valid, isValid() returns true.
 *
 * A KDateTime object can be converted to a different time specification by
 * using toUtc(), toLocalZone() or toClockTime(). It can be converted to a
 * specific time zone by toZone(). To return the time as an elapsed time since
 * 1 January 1970 (as used by time(2)), use toTime_t(). The results of time
 * zone conversions are cached to minimize the need for recalculation. Each
 * KDateTime object caches its UTC equivalent and the last time zone
 * conversion performed.
 *
 * The date and time can be set either in the constructor, or afterwards by
 * calling setDate(), setTime() or setDateTime(). To return the date and/or
 * time components of the KDateTime, use date(), time() and dateTime(). You
 * can determine whether the KDateTime represents a date and time, or a date
 * only, by isDateOnly(). You can change between a date and time or a date only
 * value using setDateOnly().
 *
 * You can increment or decrement the date/time using addSecs(), addDays(),
 * addMonths() and addYears(). The interval between two date/time values can
 * be found using secsTo() or daysTo().
 *
 * The comparison operators (operator==(), operator<(), etc.) all take the time
 * zone properly into account; if the two KDateTime objects have different time
 * zones, they are first converted to UTC before the comparison is
 * performed. An alternative to the comparison operators is compare() which will
 * in addition tell you if a KDateTime object overlaps with another when one or
 * both are date-only values.
 *
 * KDateTime values may be converted to and from a string representation using
 * the toString() and fromString() methods. These handle a variety of text
 * formats including ISO 8601 and RFC 2822.
 *
 * KDateTime uses Qt's facilities to implicitly share data. Copying instances
 * is very efficient, and copied instances share cached UTC and time zone
 * conversions even after the copy is performed. A separate copy of the data is
 * created whenever a non-const method is called. If you want to force the
 * creation of a separate copy of the data (e.g. if you want two copies to
 * cache different time zone conversions), call detach().
 *
 * @section compatibility QDateTime Considerations
 *
 * KDateTime's interface is designed to be as compatible as possible with that
 * of QDateTime, but with adjustments to cater for time zone handling. Because
 * QDateTime lacks virtual methods, KDateTime is not inherited from QDateTime,
 * but instead is implemented using a private QDateTime object.
 *
 * The date range restriction due to the use of QDateTime internally may at
 * first sight seem a design limitation. However, two factors should be
 * considered:
 *
 * - there are significant problems in the representation of dates before the
 *   Gregorian calendar was adopted. The date of adoption of the Gregorian
 *   calendar varied from place to place, and in the Julian calendar the
 *   date of the new year varied so that in different places the year number
 *   could differ by one. So any date/time system which attempted to represent
 *   dates as actually used in history would be too specialized to belong to
 *   the core KDE libraries. Date/time systems for scientific applications can
 *   be much simpler, but may differ from historical records.
 *
 * - time zones were not invented until the middle of the 19th century. Before
 *   that, solar time was used.
 *
 * Because of these issues, together with the fact that KDateTime's aim is to
 * provide automatic time zone handling for date/time values, QDateTime was
 * chosen as the basis for KDateTime. For those who need an extended date
 * range, other classes exist.
 *
 * @section simulation Simulation Facility
 *
 * This class provides a facility to simulate the local system time, which
 * affects all functions using or returning the system time. This facility is
 * provided for testing purposes only, and is only available if the library is
 * compiled with debug enabled. In release mode, simulation is inoperative and
 * the real local system time is used at all times. Use
 * setSimulatedSystemTime() to set or clear the simulated time. To read the
 * real (not simulated) system time, use realCurrentLocalDateTime().
