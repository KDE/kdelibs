bugs
====

- make expandString stuff consistent
- KConfigGroup::revertToDefault
  - does not match apidoc re. reverting to kdeglobals
  - should use entryMap.revertEntry()
  - map has no bRevert flag that could be set along with bDirty, so it
    is impossible to get rid of a once set key
- KConfigGroup::exists() should return true only if the group contains
  any non-deleted entries (?)
- immutable groups with no entries are not written out and thus lose
  their immutability.
- "C" & "en_US" should be detected early and converted to a null string
  (but also save the original string, so locale() semantics don't change
  at that point).

wishes
======

- add kconfiggroup::parentGroup()
- use lazy loading
- add $\\VAR and $\\(cmd) escapes to list-quote expanded string
- possibly:
  - preserve unchanged parts of the config literally. problem: comments
    might become stale.
  - api to actively add comments to files, groups and keys
  - guaranteeing that write order of new keys is preserved
- possibly: selective multi-level master diversion
  - this is to support roaming profiles that have machine/user/etc. specific
    settings
  - files, groups and keys can have [$m] and [$s] markers; these cascade
    within each file only. the least significant object (farthest away from
    the master) with an effective $m mode becomes the master (i.e., is
    written to and not read past)..
    default is $m for the master file and $s for the default files.
  - the CascadeConfig flag being unset doesn't make things exactly simpler
  - can kdeglobals be handled by this?
  - does this really make sense? promoting an object to profile wide status
    is a conscious decision - which probably needs to be repeated every time
    the value changes.

internals
=========

- the handling of opening kdeglobals explicitly seems weird, at least.
  couldn't it simply mask out IncludeGlobals and thus handle it as any
  other config without globals instead of spreading kdeglobals special
  cases all over the place?
- clear up bDeleted vs. isNull in entrymap
- make entrymap truly hierarchical
  - an entry map contains its flags, a map of keys and a map of submaps.
    it does NOT contain its name and has no parent pointer.
  - when creating a kconfiggroup, ask parent for the respective submap
    and link it if it is present. if it is not, create one at write op,
    link it and tell parent to add it to its entry map. both query and
    creation are recursive, obviously.
    a kconfiggroup DOES contain its name and has a parent pointer.

overwriting semantics
=====================

generally:
- localized entries cannot exist without an unlocalized "primary" entry,
  so writing a localized key when no corresponding unlocalized key
  exists should print a warning and copy the value to the unlocalized
  key.
- a primary entry in the user config overshadows not only the immediate
  default, but also any localizations of the default. applies also to a
  [$d] marker, obviously.
  a localized entry in the user config overshadows only that
  localization from the default.

- key exists in local config => overwritten
- key does not exist => created
yes, that's the trivial case.

- the key itself is handled trivially
- if localizations exist in the local config, they are actively purged
- localizations in the default config don't matter, as they will be
  overshadowed by the unlocalized key in the local config

> > - deleting an entry also deletes all localizations.
- if default exists, write [$d] entry
- if no default exists, delete entry
- if localizations exist in the local config, they are actively purged
- localizations in the default config don't matter, as they will be
  overshadowed by the unlocalized key in the local config (as
  localizations cannot exist without a primary key, a deletion marker
  key will be present).

> > - reverting a key to default also restores all localizations.
- any local entries are actively purged
