/**
 * \class KConfig kconfig.h <KConfig>
 *
 * \brief The central class of the KDE configuration data system.
 *
 * Quickstart:
 *
 * Get the default application config object via KGlobal::config().
 *
 * Load a specific configuration file:
 * \code
 * KConfig config( "/etc/kderc", KConfig::SimpleConfig );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Load the configuration of a specific component (taking into account
 * possible custom directories in KStandardDirs):
 * \code
 * KConfig config( componentData(), "pluginrc" );
 * \endcode
 *
 * In general it is recommended to use KSharedConfig instead of
 * creating multiple instances of KConfig to avoid the overhead of
 * separate objects or concerns about synchronizing writes to disk
 * even if the configuration object is updated from multiple code paths.
 * KSharedConfig provides a set of open methods as counterparts for the
 * KConfig constructors.
 *
 * \sa KSharedConfig, KConfigGroup, <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Development/Tutorials/KConfig">the techbase HOWTO on KConfig</a>.
