/**
 * A wrapper class for the most commonly used encoding and
 * decoding algorithms.  Currently there is support for encoding
 * and decoding input using base64, uu and the quoted-printable
 * specifications.
 *
 * \b Usage:
 *
 * \code
 * QCString input = "Aladdin:open sesame";
 * QCString result = KCodecs::base64Encode(input);
 * cout << "Result: " << result.data() << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * <pre>
 * Output should be
 * Result: QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example makes use of the convenience functions
 * (ones that accept/return null-terminated strings) to encode/decode
 * a string.  If what you need is to encode or decode binary data, then
 * it is highly recommended that you use the functions that take an input
 * and output QByteArray as arguments.  These functions are specifically
 * tailored for encoding and decoding binary data.

/**
 * @short An adapted C++ implementation of RSA Data Securities MD5 algorithm.
 *
 * The default constructor is designed to provide much the same
 * functionality as the most commonly used C-implementation, while
 * the other three constructors are meant to further simplify the
 * process of obtaining a digest by calculating the result in a
 * single step.
 *
 * KMD5 is state-based, that means you can add new contents with
 * update() as long as you didn't request the digest value yet.
 * After the digest value was requested, the object is "finalized"
 * and you have to call reset() to be able to do another calculation
 * with it.  The reason for this behavior is that upon requesting
 * the message digest KMD5 has to pad the received contents up to a
 * 64 byte boundary to calculate its value. After this operation it
 * is not possible to resume consuming data.
 *
 * \b Usage:
 *
 * A common usage of this class:
 *
 * \code
 * const char* test1;
 * KMD5::Digest rawResult;
 *
 * test1 = "This is a simple test.";
 * KMD5 context (test1);
 * cout << "Hex Digest output: " << context.hexDigest().data() << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * To cut down on the unnecessary overhead of creating multiple KMD5
 * objects, you can simply invoke reset() to reuse the same object
 * in making another calculation:
 *
 * \code
 * context.reset ();
 * context.update ("TWO");
 * context.update ("THREE");
 * cout << "Hex Digest output: " << context.hexDigest().data() << endl;
 * \endcode
