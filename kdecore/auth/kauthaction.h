/**
 * @brief Class to access, authorize and execute actions.
 *
 * This is the main class of the kauth API. It provides the interface to
 * manipulate actions. Every action is identified by its name. Every instance
 * of the Action class with the same name refers to the same action.
 *
 * Once you have an action object you can tell the helper to execute it
 * (asking the user to authenticate if needed) with one of the execute*() methods.
 * The simplest thing to do is to execute a single action synchronously
 * blocking for the reply, using the execute() method.
 *
 * For asynchronous calls, use the executeAsync() method. It sends the request
 * to the helper and returns immediately. You can optionally provide an object
 * and a slot. This will be connected to the actionPerformed() signal of the
 * action's ActionWatcher object.
 * By calling the watcher() method, you obtain an object that emits some useful
 * signals that you can receive while the action is in progress. Those signals
 * are emitted also with the synchronous calls.
 * To execute a bunch of actions with a single call, you can use the executeActions()
 * static method. This is not the same as calling executeAsync() for each action,
 * because the actions are execute with a single request to the helper.
 * To use any of the execute*() methods you have to set the default helper's ID using
 * the setHelperID() static method. Alternatively, you can specify the helperID using
 * the overloaded version of the methods that takes it as a parameter.
 *
 * Each action object contains a QVariantMap object that is passed directly to the
 * helper when the action is executed. You can access this map using the arguments()
 * method. You can insert into it any kind of custom data you need to pass to the helper.
