/**
* @short Site-independent access to standard KDE directories.
* @author Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org> and Sirtaj Singh Kang <taj@kde.org>
* @version $Id$
*
* This is one of the most central classes in kdelibs as
* it provides a basic service: It knows where the files
* reside on the user's hard disk. And it's meant to be the
* only one that knows -- to make the real location as
* transparent as possible to both the user and the applications.
*
* To this end it insulates the application from all information
* and applications always refer to a file with a resource type
* (e.g. icon) and a filename (e.g. khexdit.xpm). In an ideal world
* the application would make no assumption where this file is and
* leave it up to @ref KStandardDirs::findResource("apps", "Home.desktop")
* to apply this knowledge to return /opt/kde/share/applnk/Home.desktop
* or locate("data", "kgame/background.jpg") to return
* /opt/kde/share/apps/kgame/background.jpg
*
* The main idea behind @ref KStandardDirs is that there are several
* toplevel prefixes below which the files lie. One of these prefixes is
* the one where the user installed kdelibs, one is where the
* application was installed, and one is $HOME/.kde, but there
* may be even more. Under these prefixes there are several well
* defined suffixes where specific resource types are to be found.
* For example, for the resource type "html" the suffixes could be
* share/doc/HTML and share/doc/kde/HTML.
* So the search algorithm basicly appends to each prefix each registered
* suffix and tries to locate the file there.
* To make the thing even more complex, it's also possible to register
* absolute paths that @ref KStandardDirs looks up after not finding anything
* in the former steps. They can be useful if the user wants to provide
* specific directories that aren't in his $HOME/.kde directory for,
* for example, icons.
*
* @sect Standard resources that kdelibs allocates are:
*
* @li apps - Applications menu (.desktop files).
* @li cgi - CGIs to run from kdehelp.
* @li config - Configuration files.
* @li data - Where applications store data.
* @li exe - Executables in $prefix/bin. @ref #findExe for a function that takes $PATH into account.
* @li html - HTML documentation.
* @li icon - Icons, see @ref KIconLoader.
* @li lib - Libraries.
* @li locale - Translation files for @ref KLocale.
* @li mime - Mime types.
* @li module - Module (dynamically loaded library).
* @li qtplugins - Qt plugins (dynamically loaded objects for Qt)
* @li services - Services.
* @li servicetypes - Service types.
* @li sound - Application sounds.
* @li templates - Templates
* @li wallpaper - Wallpapers.
* @li tmp - Temporary files (specfic for both current host and current user)
* @li socket - UNIX Sockets (specific for both current host and current user)
*
* A type that is added by the class KApplication if you use it, is
* appdata. This one makes the use of the type data a bit easier as it
* appends the name of the application.
* So while you had to @ref locate("data", "appname/filename") so you can
* also write @ref locate("appdata", "filename") if your KApplication instance
* is called "appname". Please note though that you cannot use the "appdata"
* type if you intend to use it in an applet for Kicker because 'appname' would
* be "Kicker" instead of the applet's name. Therefore, for applets, you've got
* to work around this by using @ref locate("data", "appletname/filename").
*
* @sect KStandardDirs supports the following environment variables:
*
* @li KDEDIRS: This may set an additional number of directory prefixes to
*          search for resources. The directories should be seperated
*          by ':'. The directories are searched in the order they are
*          specified.
* @li KDEDIR:  Used for backwards compatibility. As KDEDIRS but only a single
*          directory may be specified. If KDEDIRS is set KDEDIR is
*          ignored.
* @li KDEHOME: The directory where changes are saved to. This directory is
*          used to search for resources first. If KDEHOME is not
*          specified it defaults to "$HOME/.kde"
*

/**
 * On The Usage Of 'locate' and 'locateLocal'
 *
 * Typical KDE applications use resource files in one out of
 * three ways:
 *
 * 1) A resource file is read but is never written. A system
 *    default is supplied but the user can override this
 *    default in his local .kde directory:
 *
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locate("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile); // myFile may be null
 *
 * 2) A resource file is read and written. If the user has no
 *    local version of the file the system default is used.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locate("appdata", "groups.lst")
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile);
 *    ...
 *    doSomething(myData);
 *    ...
 *    myFile = locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myWriteGroups(myFile, myData);
 *
 * 3) A resource file is read and written. No system default
 *    is used if the user has no local version of the file.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile);
 *    ...
