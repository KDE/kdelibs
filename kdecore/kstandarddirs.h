/**
 * @short Site-independent access to standard KDE directories.
 * @author Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org> and Sirtaj Singh Kang <taj@kde.org>
 * @version $Id$
 *
 * This is one of the most central classes in kdelibs as
 * it provides a basic service: It knows where the files
 * reside on the user's hard disk. And it's meant to be the
 * only one that knows -- to make the real location as
 * transparent as possible to both the user and the applications.
 *
 * To this end it insulates the application from all information
 * and applications always refer to a file with a resource type
 * (e.g. icon) and a filename (e.g. khexdit.xpm). In an ideal world
 * the application would make no assumption where this file is and
 * leave it up to KStandardDirs::findResource("apps", "Home.desktop")
 * to apply this knowledge to return /opt/kde/share/applnk/Home.desktop
 * or ::locate("data", "kgame/background.jpg") to return
 * /opt/kde/share/apps/kgame/background.jpg
 *
 * The main idea behind KStandardDirs is that there are several
 * toplevel prefixes below which the files lie. One of these prefixes is
 * the one where the user installed kdelibs, one is where the
 * application was installed, and one is $HOME/.kde, but there
 * may be even more. Under these prefixes there are several well
 * defined suffixes where specific resource types are to be found.
 * For example, for the resource type "html" the suffixes could be
 * share/doc/HTML and share/doc/kde/HTML.
 * So the search algorithm basically appends to each prefix each registered
 * suffix and tries to locate the file there.
 * To make the thing even more complex, it's also possible to register
 * absolute paths that KStandardDirs looks up after not finding anything
 * in the former steps. They can be useful if the user wants to provide
 * specific directories that aren't in his $HOME/.kde directory for,
 * for example, icons.
 *
 * <b>Standard resources that kdelibs allocates are:</b>\n
 *
 * @li apps - Applications menu (.desktop files).
 * @li cache - Cached information (e.g. favicons, web-pages)
 * @li cgi - CGIs to run from kdehelp.
 * @li config - Configuration files.
 * @li data - Where applications store data.
 * @li exe - Executables in $prefix/bin. findExe() for a function that takes $PATH into account.
 * @li html - HTML documentation.
 * @li icon - Icons, see KIconLoader.
 * @li lib - Libraries.
 * @li locale - Translation files for KLocale.
 * @li mime - Mime types.
 * @li module - Module (dynamically loaded library).
 * @li qtplugins - Qt plugins (dynamically loaded objects for Qt)
 * @li services - Services.
 * @li servicetypes - Service types.
 * @li scripts - Application scripting additions.
 * @li sound - Application sounds.
 * @li templates - Templates
 * @li wallpaper - Wallpapers.
 * @li tmp - Temporary files (specific for both current host and current user)
 * @li socket - UNIX Sockets (specific for both current host and current user)
 *
 * A type that is added by the class KApplication if you use it, is
 * appdata. This one makes the use of the type data a bit easier as it
 * appends the name of the application.
 * So while you had to ::locate("data", "appname/filename") so you can
 * also write ::locate("appdata", "filename") if your KApplication instance
 * is called "appname" (as set via KApplication's constructor or KAboutData, if
 * you use the global KStandardDirs object KGlobal::dirs()).
 * Please note though that you cannot use the "appdata"
 * type if you intend to use it in an applet for Kicker because 'appname' would
 * be "Kicker" instead of the applet's name. Therefore, for applets, you've got
 * to work around this by using ::locate("data", "appletname/filename").
 *
 * <b>KStandardDirs supports the following environment variables:</b>
 *
 * @li KDEDIRS: This may set an additional number of directory prefixes to
 *          search for resources. The directories should be separated
 *          by ':'. The directories are searched in the order they are
 *          specified.
 * @li KDEDIR:  Used for backwards compatibility. As KDEDIRS but only a single
 *          directory may be specified. If KDEDIRS is set KDEDIR is
 *          ignored.
 * @li KDEHOME: The directory where changes are saved to. This directory is
 *          used to search for resources first. If KDEHOME is not
 *          specified it defaults to "$HOME/.kde"
 * @li KDEROOTHOME: Like KDEHOME, but used for the root user.
 *          If KDEROOTHOME is not set it defaults to the .kde directory in the
 *          home directory of root, usually "/root/.kde".
 *          Note that the setting of $HOME is ignored in this case.
 *

/**
 * \addtogroup locates Locate Functions
 *  @{
 * On The Usage Of 'locate' and 'locateLocal'
 *
 * Typical KDE applications use resource files in one out of
 * three ways:
 *
 * 1) A resource file is read but is never written. A system
 *    default is supplied but the user can override this
 *    default in his local .kde directory:
 *
 *    \code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locate("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile); // myFile may be null
 *    \endcode
 *
 * 2) A resource file is read and written. If the user has no
 *    local version of the file the system default is used.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    \code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locate("appdata", "groups.lst")
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile);
 *    ...
 *    doSomething(myData);
 *    ...
 *    myFile = locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myWriteGroups(myFile, myData);
 *    \endcode
 *
 * 3) A resource file is read and written. No system default
 *    is used if the user has no local version of the file.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    \code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
