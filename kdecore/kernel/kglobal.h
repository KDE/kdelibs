/**
 * This macro makes it easy to use non-POD types as global statics.
 * The object is created on first use and creation is threadsafe.
 *
 * The object is destructed on library unload or application exit.
 * Be careful with calling other objects in the destructor of the class
 * as you have to be sure that they (or objects they depend on) are not already destructed.
 *
 * @param TYPE The type of the global static object. Do not add a *.
 * @param NAME The name of the function to get a pointer to the global static object.
 *
 * If you have code that might be called after the global object has been destroyed you can check
 * for that using the isDestroyed() function.
 *
 * If needed (If the destructor of the global object calls other functions that depend on other
 * global statics (e.g. KConfig::sync) your destructor has to be called before those global statics
 * are destroyed. A Qt post routine does that.) you can also install a post routine (@ref qAddPostRoutine) to clean up the object
 * using the destroy() method. If you registered a post routine and the object is destroyed because
 * of a lib unload you have to call qRemovePostRoutine!
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * class A {
 * public:
 *     ~A();
 *     ...
 * };
 *
 * K_GLOBAL_STATIC(A, globalA)
 * // The above creates a new globally static variable named 'globalA' which you
 * // can use as a pointer to an instance of A.
 *
 * void doSomething()
 * {
 *     //  The first time you access globalA a new instance of A will be created automatically.
 *     A *a = globalA;
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * void doSomethingElse()
 * {
 *     if (globalA.isDestroyed()) {
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     A *a = globalA;
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * void installPostRoutine()
 * {
 *     // A post routine can be used to delete the object when QCoreApplication destructs,
 *     // not adding such a post routine will delete the object normally at program unload
 *     qAddPostRoutine(globalA.destroy);
 * }
 *
 * A::~A()
 * {
 *     // When you install a post routine you have to remove the post routine from the destructor of
 *     // the class used as global static!
 *     qRemovePostRoutine(globalA.destroy);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * A common case for the need of deletion on lib unload/app shutdown are Singleton classes. Here's
 * an example how to do it:
 * @code
 * class MySingletonPrivate;
 * class EXPORT_MACRO MySingleton
 * {
 * friend class MySingletonPrivate;
 * public:
 *     static MySingleton *self();
 *     QString someFunction();
 *
 * private:
 *     MySingleton();
 *     ~MySingleton();
 * };
 * @endcode
 * in the .cpp file:
 * @code
 * // This class will be instantiated and referenced as a singleton in this example
 * class MySingletonPrivate
 * {
 * public:
 *     QString foo;
 *     MySingleton instance;
 * };
 *
 * K_GLOBAL_STATIC(MySingletonPrivate, mySingletonPrivate)
 *
 * MySingleton *MySingleton::self()
 * {
 *     // returns the singleton; automatically creates a new instance if that has not happened yet.
 *     return &mySingletonPrivate->instance;
 * }
 * QString MySingleton::someFunction()
 * {
 *     // Refencing the singleton directly is possible for your convenience
 *     return mySingletonPrivate->foo;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Instead of the above you can use also the following pattern (ignore the name of the namespace):
 * @code
 * namespace MySingleton
 * {
 *     EXPORT_MACRO QString someFunction();
 * }
 * @endcode
 * in the .cpp file:
 * @code
 * class MySingletonPrivate
 * {
 * public:
 *     QString foo;
 * };
 *
 * K_GLOBAL_STATIC(MySingletonPrivate, mySingletonPrivate)
 *
 * QString MySingleton::someFunction()
 * {
 *     return mySingletonPrivate->foo;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now code that wants to call someFunction() doesn't have to do
 * @code
 * MySingleton::self()->someFunction();
 * @endcode
 * anymore but instead:
 * @code
 * MySingleton::someFunction();
 * @endcode
