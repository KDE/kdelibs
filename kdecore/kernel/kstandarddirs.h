/**
 * @short Site-independent access to standard KDE directories.
 * @author Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org> and Sirtaj Singh Kang <taj@kde.org>
 *
 * This is one of the most central classes in kdelibs: It knows where KDE-related files
 * reside on the user's hard disk. It's meant to be the only one that knows --
 * so applications and the end user don't have to.
 *
 * Applications should always refer to a file with a resource type.
 * The application should leave it up to e.g.
 * KStandardDirs::findResource("xdgdata-apps", "Home.desktop")
 * to return the desired path <tt>/opt/kde/share/applications/Home.desktop</tt>
 * or ::locate("data", "kgame/background.jpg") to return
 * <tt>/opt/kde/share/kgame/background.jpg</tt>
 *
 * There are several toplevel prefixes under which files can be located.
 * One of them is the kdelibs install location, one is the application
 * install location, and one used to be <tt>$KDEHOME</tt>, no longer applicable
 * in KDE Frameworks 5 (splitted into XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME, mostly).
 *
 * Under these toplevel prefixes there are several well-defined suffixes
 * where specific resource types can be found.
 * For example, for the resource type @c "html" the suffixes could be
 * @c share/doc/HTML and @c share/doc/kde/HTML.
 * The search algorithm tries to locate the file under each prefix-suffix
 * combination.
 *
 * It is also possible to register
 * absolute paths that KStandardDirs looks up after not finding anything
 * in the former steps. They can be useful if the user wants to provide
 * specific directories that aren't in his <tt>$KDEHOME</tt> directory, for
 * example for icons.
 *
 * <b>Standard resources that kdelibs allocates are:</b>
 *
 * @li @c autostart - Autostart directories (both XDG and kde-specific) (deprecated since 5.0, use xdgconf-autostart)
 * @li @c cache - Cached information (e.g. favicons, web-pages)
 * @li @c config - Configuration files.
 * @li @c data - Where applications store data.
 * @li @c emoticons - Emoticons themes
 * @li @c exe - Executables in $prefix/bin. findExe() for a function that takes $PATH into account.
 * @li @c html - HTML documentation.
 * @li @c icon - Icons, see KIconLoader.
 * @li @c kcfg - KConfigXT config files.
 * @li @c lib - Libraries.
 * @li @c locale - Translation files for KLocale.
 * @li @c module - Module (dynamically loaded library).
 * @li @c qtplugins - Qt plugins (dynamically loaded objects for Qt)
 * @li @c services - Services.
 * @li @c servicetypes - Service types.
 * @li @c sound - Application sounds.
 * @li @c templates - Templates for the "Create new file" functionality.
 * @li @c wallpaper - Wallpapers.
 * @li @c tmp - Temporary files (specific for both current host and current user)
 * @li @c socket - UNIX Sockets (specific for both current host and current user)
 * @li @c xdgconf-menu - Freedesktop.org standard location for menu layout (.menu) files.
 * @li @c xdgdata-apps - Freedesktop.org standard location for application desktop files.
 * @li @c xdgdata-dirs - Freedesktop.org standard location for menu descriptions (.directory files).
 * @li @c xdgdata-mime - Freedesktop.org standard location for MIME type definitions.
 * @li @c xdgdata-icon - Freedesktop.org standard location for icons.
 * @li @c xdgdata-pixmap - Gnome-compatibility location for pixmaps.
 *
 * A type that is added by the class KApplication if you use it, is
 * @c appdata. This one makes the use of the type data a bit easier as it
 * appends the name of the application.
 * So while you had to ::locate("data", "appname/filename") so you can
 * also write ::locate("appdata", "filename") if your KApplication instance
 * is called @c "appname" (as set via KApplication's constructor or KAboutData, if
 * you use the global KStandardDirs object KGlobal::dirs()).
 * Please note though that you cannot use the @c "appdata"
 * type if you intend to use it in an applet for Kicker because 'appname' would
 * be @c "Kicker" instead of the applet's name. Therefore, for applets, you've got
 * to work around this by using ::locate("data", "appletname/filename").
 *
 * <b>KStandardDirs supports the following environment variables:</b>
 *
 * @li @c KDEDIRS - This may set an additional number of directory prefixes to
 *          search for resources. The directories should be separated
 *          by <tt>':'</tt>. The directories are searched in the order they are
 *          specified.
 * @li @c KDEHOME - The directory where changes are saved to. This directory is
 *          used to search for resources first. If @c KDEHOME is not
 *          specified it defaults to @c "$HOME/.kde"
 * @li @c KDEROOTHOME - Like KDEHOME, but used for the root user.
 *          If @c KDEROOTHOME is not set it defaults to the <tt>.kde</tt> directory in the
 *          home directory of root, usually @c "/root/.kde".
 *          Note that the setting of @c $HOME is ignored in this case.
 *
 * @see KGlobalSettings
 *
 *
 * On The Usage Of 'locate' and 'locateLocal'
 *
 * Typical KDE applications use resource files in one out of
 * three ways:
 *
 * 1) A resource file is read but is never written. A system
 *    default is supplied but the user can override this
 *    default in his local .kde directory:
 *
 *    @code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = KStandardDirs::locate("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile); // myFile may be null
 *    @endcode
 *
 * 2) A resource file is read and written. If the user has no
 *    local version of the file the system default is used.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    @code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = KStandardDirs::locate("appdata", "groups.lst")
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile);
 *    ...
 *    doSomething(myData);
 *    ...
 *    myFile = KStandardDirs::locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myWriteGroups(myFile, myData);
 *    @endcode
 *
 * 3) A resource file is read and written. No system default
 *    is used if the user has no local version of the file.
 *    The resource file is always written to the users local
 *    .kde directory.
 *
 *    @code
 *    // Code example
 *    myFile = KStandardDirs::locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myData =  myReadGroups(myFile);
 *    ...
 *    doSomething(myData);
 *    ...
 *    myFile = KStandardDirs::locateLocal("appdata", "groups.lst");
 *    myWriteGroups(myFile, myData);
 *    @endcode
