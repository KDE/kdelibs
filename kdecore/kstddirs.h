/**
* Site-independent access to standard KDE directories.
*
* The various directory accessors allow you to access the various
* KDE FSSTND directories in a portable way.
*
* Since the KDE FSSTND is heirarchical, the accessors provide the
* ability to get the directory in the most to the least specific
* location (in order, Application/User/System);
*
* Additionally, each accessor has the ability to find the most
* specific directory that actually exists. The default is no check
* whether the directory exists.
* 
* Ordinarily, you will not want to manually instantiate this class.
* The global @ref KApplication object instantiates and provides const 
* access to a KStandardDirs object via the 
* @ref KApplication::dirs method.
