Since kab uses the STL, and there are at least two versions 
around that are not compatible, it can be really hard to get 
kab compiled. Additionally, there are some problems with X 
headers that define macros like "O" that really confuse the 
compiler.
In the current sources, the STL version is determined auto-
matically, if yours is supported. This should solve most of 
the errors that happened before. Please note that the STL is
usually provided by the C++ compiler you use. Using gcc or 
egcs, you should not have problems.
In this file I collect some solutions for solving compilation 
problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------
1.) The compiler complains about something like this
>keyvaluemap.cc: In method `bool KeyValueMap::insertLine
>(class basic_string<char,string_char_traits<char>,
>__default_alloc_template<true,0> >, 
>bool = false, bool = false, bool = true)':
>keyvaluemap.cc:476: no matching function for call to 
>`basic_string<char,string_char_traits<char>,
>__default_alloc_template<true,0> >::remove 
>(unsigned int &, int)'.

Solution: Set the STL version you use in the file 
libkab/stl_headers.h. Use HP STL for libg++ < 2.8, SGI STL for
libg++ >=2.8.
With this error message, you probably have a copy of the 
SGI STL.

2.) The compiler complains in the same way like before, but
it says something about "erase" instead of "remove?

Solution: This is the same problem as before, but you need to 
select the HP STL.

3.) The compiler says:
    >The STL version has not been selected. You need to
    >choose the STL version you use manually. 
    >Read the file COMPILE_PROBLEMS_FAQ.   

Solution: The configure script did not find any supported STL
version on your system. Possibly you will not get kab's sources
compiled. Contact Mirko Sucker (mirko@kde.org) and mail him you 
system configuration and possible solutions you find. Do not 
mind if you only report the problem...

99.) The compiler complains about anything else.

Solution: mail the error to
  mirko@kde.org
.
