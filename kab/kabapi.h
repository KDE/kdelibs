/**
  * The class KabAPI provides a public interface to access the
  * users address database created using kab. The complete
  * functionality regarding database operations provided by kab is
  * available using an object of this class.
  *
  * The class is derived from the class KDialogBase, thus objects
  * can be used as a KDE dialog where the user may select a person
  * out of the entries in his personal database.
  * The following code may be used to let the user select an address:
  * \code
  * KabAPI kabapi(this);
  * if(dialog.init()!=KabAPI::NoError)
  *   {
  *     ... error handling
  *   }
  * AddressBook::Entry entry;
  * if(kabapi.exec())
  *   {
  *     if(!kabapi.getEntry(entry))
  *       {
  *         // ... the database is empty
  *       } else {
  *         // ... use the entry
  *       }
  *   }
  * ...
  * \endcode
  * Some methods declared here return keys of entries. The keys are of the
  * datatype KabKey. Every key
  * is (of course) unique and identifying. If you store it, you can access
  * the entry it represents with it. Be careful that the entry may have been
  * deleted by another program instance meanwhile!
  * <tt>Please be careful to test for the return code NotImplemented as
  * long the kab API is not completely finished.</tt>
  * @short The class KabAPI defines the API to access user address databases.
