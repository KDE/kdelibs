 * may be executed more than once at the same time. See match() for details.
 * To let krunner expose a global shortcut for the single runner query mode, the runner
 * must set the "X-Plasma-AdvertiseSingleRunnerMode" key to true in the .desktop file 
 * and set a default syntax. See setDefaultSyntax() for details.

         * This is the main query method. It should trigger creation of
         * QueryMatch instances through RunnerContext::addMatch and
         * RunnerContext::addMatches. It is called internally by performMatch().
         *
         * If the runner can run precisely the requested term (RunnerContext::query()),
         * it should create an exact match by setting the type to RunnerContext::ExactMatch.
         * The first runner that creates a QueryMatch will be the
         * default runner. Other runner's matches will be suggested in the
         * interface. Non-exact matches should be offered via RunnerContext::PossibleMatch.
         *
         * The match will be activated via run() if the user selects it.
         *
         * Each runner is executed in its own thread. Whenever the user input changes this
         * method is called again. Thus, it needs to be thread-safe. Also, all matches need
         * to be reported once this method returns. Asynchronous runners therefore need
         * to make use of a local event loop to wait for all matches.
         *
         * It is recommended to use local status data in async runners. The simplest way is
         * to have a separate class doing all the work like so:
         *
         * \code
         * void MyFancyAsyncRunner::match( RunnerContext& context )
         * {
         *     QEventLoop loop;
         *     MyAsyncWorker worker( context );
         *     connect( &worker, SIGNAL(finished()),
         *              &loop, SLOT(quit()) );
         *     worker.work();
         *     loop.exec();
         * }
         * \endcode
         *
         * Here MyAsyncWorker creates all the matches and calls RunnerContext::addMatch
         * in some internal slot. It emits the finished() signal once done which will
         * quit the loop and make the match() method return. The local status is kept
         * entirely in MyAsyncWorker which makes match() trivially thread-safe.
         *
         * If a particular match supports multiple actions, set up the corresponding
         * actions in the actionsForMatch method. Do not call any of the action methods
         * within this method!
         *
         * Execution of the correct action should be handled in the run method.
         * @caution This method needs to be thread-safe since KRunner will simply
         * start a new thread for each new term.
         *
         * @warning Returning from this method means to end execution of the runner.
