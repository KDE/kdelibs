Implementation Items
====================
* Applet::screenRect

Functionality Blocks
====================
* QML Wallpaper
* QML Containment
    * port Sebas' work for QML Containment to libplasma2
    * wallpaper loading
    * action plugins access
    * applet geometry save/restore
    * move ContainmentPrivate::dropData to be a protected member (slot?) so QML Containment can
      provide a drop action
* ContainmentActions
    * add ToolBox as a recognized trigger
    * only return sets of actions
* PopupApplet -> merge into Applet with functionality implemented in QML rather than in libplasma
* QML Tooltips
    * ToolTipManager -> replace with a QML component
    * QML tips
* View -> dump
* Default Package classes
    * Can this be provided by the graphics system specialization?
* make (all?) plugins able to only be available from specific workspaces
    * does this mean simply implementing pluginLoaders for the shells?
    * better yet -> add shell-specific constraints for PluginLoader to use
    * OR not exists [X-Plasma-<something>] or [X-Plasma-<something>] = 'foo'

Porting of Applet and Containment
=================================

* ContainmentPrivate::appletAt(const QPointF &point)   -> depends from ContainmentActions refactoring : disabled now in the code
* ContainmentPrivate::setScreen(int newScreen, int newDesktop, bool preventInvalidDesktops)
* all geometry functions in Applet and Containment (width, height, geometry, raise, lower...)
