 *
 * This is the class where every message to or from another machine passes through.
 * It's responsibilities are:
 * - creating/keeping a credentials used for message signing.
 * - verifying credentials of incoming messages.
 * - testing whether or not the sender is allowed to access the requested resource by testing the
 *   request to a set of rules.
 * - allowing the shell to respond to a remote request that doesn't match any of the rules that
 *   are in effect.
 * Besides internal use in libplasma, the only moment you'll need to access this class is when you
 * implement a plasma shell.
