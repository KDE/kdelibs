/**
 * @class AuthorizationRule plasma/authorizationrule.h <Plasma/AuthorizationRule>
 *
 * @short Defines a rule indicating whether or not a certain service can be accessed by a certain
 * machine.
 *
 * Rules allow you to have control over which computers are allowed to access which
 * services. Every time a message get's in, AuthorizationManager validates it's sender, and then
 * checks it's list of rules for rules matching the sender and/or the service. If no rules match,
 * or all matching rules have the value Unspecified, AuthorizationManager will create a new rule
 * for this message, and invoke authorize on your shells implementation of AuthorizationInterface.
 * Here, you can change that rule to either allow or deny that request.
 * This class can be used to specify different types of rules:
 * - Rules matching only a user
 * - Rules matching only a service
 * - Rules matching both a service, and a user.
 * A more specific rule always takes precedence over a more global rule: so if for example you have
 * a rule for "myAwesomeService" specifying Deny, and a rule for "myAwesomeService" in combination
 * with "130.42.120.146" as caller specifying Allow, only 130.42.120.146 can access
 * myAwesomeService.
 * By setting the PinRequired flag in setRules in an AuthorizationInterface implementation, you
 * trigger Pin pairing (user will be asked to enter the same password on both machines).
 *
 * @since 4.4?
