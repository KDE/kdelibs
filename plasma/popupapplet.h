 * base class for any applet that wishes to use extenders.
 *
 * Applets that subclass this class should implement either widget() or graphicsWidget() to return a
 * widget that will be displayed in the applet if the applet is in a Planar or MediaCenter form
 * factor. If the applet is put in a panel, an icon will be displayed instead, which shows the
 * widget in a popup when clicked.
 *
 * If you use this class as a base class for your extender using applet, the extender will
 * automatically be used for the popup; reimplementing graphicsWidget() is unnecessary in this case.
 *
 * If you need a popup that does not steal window focus when openend or used, set window flag
 * Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint the widget returned by widget() or graphicsWidget().
