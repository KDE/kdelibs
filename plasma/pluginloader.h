 * This is an abstract base class which defines an interface to which Plasma's 
 * Applet Loading logic can communicate with a parent application. The plugin loader
 * must be set before any plugins are loaded, otherwise (for safety reasons), the
 * default PluginLoader implementation will be used. The reimplemented version should
 * not do more than simply returning a loaded plugin. It should not init() it, and it should not
 * hang on to it. The associated methods will be called only when a component of Plasma
 * needs to load a _new_ plugin. (e.g. DataEngine does it's own caching).
