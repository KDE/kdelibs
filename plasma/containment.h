/**
 * @class Containment plasma/containment.h <Plasma/Containment>
 *
 * @short The base class for plugins that provide backgrounds and applet grouping containers
 *
 * Containment objects provide the means to group applets into functional sets.
 * They also provide the following:
 *
 * creation of focussing event
 * - drawing of the background image (which can be interactive)
 * - form factors (e.g. panel, desktop, full screen, etc)
 * - applet layout management
 *
 * Since containment is actually just a Plasma::Applet, all the techniques used
 * for writing the visual presentation of Applets is applicable to Containtments.
 * Containments are differentiated from Applets by being marked with the ServiceType
 * of Plasma/Containment. Plugins registered with both the Applet and the Containment
 * ServiceTypes can be loaded for us in either situation.
 *
 * See techbase.kde.org for a tutorial on writing Containments using this class.
