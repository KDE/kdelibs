/**
 * Inter-process communication and remote procedure calls
 * for KDE applications.
 *
 * This class provides IPC and RPC for KDE applications.  Usually you
 * will not have to instantiate one yourself because KApplication
 * contains a method to return a pointer to a DCOPClient object which
 * can be used for your whole application.
 *
 * Before being able to send or receive any DCOP messages, you will have
 * to attach your client object to the DCOP server, and then register
 * your application with a specific name. See attach()
 * and registerAs() for
 * more information.
 *
 * Data to be sent should be serialized into a QDataStream which was
 * initialized with the QByteArray that you actually intend to send
 * the data in.  An example of how you might do this:
 *
 * \code
 *   QByteArray data;
 *   QDataStream arg(data, IO_WriteOnly);
 *   arg << QString("This is text I am serializing");
 *   client->send("someApp", "someObject", "someFunction(QString)", data);
 * \endcode
 *
 * @see KApplication::dcopClient()
